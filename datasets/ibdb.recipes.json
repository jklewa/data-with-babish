    "raw_procedure": "Heat milk to 110\u00b0F.  Add yeast and a pinch of sugar to milk, and allow to sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes, or until foaming. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg.  Affix dough hook, and add yeast mixture. Mix for 1 minute or until barely combined. Add eggs and mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes, or until the dough pulls away from the bowl of the mixer, and forms a cohesive ball. Add half the butter, and beat on medium speed for 5-7 minutes, until incorporated. Repeat with remaining butter, adding flour 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky.  Form the dough into a ball, place in a large buttered bowl, and cover with a clean kitchen towel.  Place in an off oven and allow to rise for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove dough, punch down, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight (or at a minimum of 4 hours).\nTo make simple syrup, combine sugar and water, and simmer until syrupy, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely.\nIf making chocolate babka, melt butter and chocolate together on medium power in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until completely smooth.  Whisk in espresso powder, cocoa powder, and powdered sugar until a spreadable paste forms.\nIf making cinnamon babka, combine cinnamon, sugar, and melted butter, combining thoroughly until a spreadable paste forms.\nRemove dough from the refrigerator, divide in half, and roll out to a 24 x 18 inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface.  Spread evenly with desired filling, leaving a 1-inch gap around all sides. Roll into log lengthwise, and place in the freezer for 15-20 minutes, or until firm. Repeat with the other half of dough.\nRemove dough roll from the freezer, and using a bread knife, cut down the middle lengthwise, exposing all the chocolate/cinnamon layers.  Hold the two halves of dough against each other so the cut sides are facing out, and twist into a decorative loaf. Watch the video to see it done! Place in buttered, parchment-lined loaf pans, cover with a damp towel, and allow to rise in the off oven for 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the thickest part of the loaf comes out clean. Remove from the oven, place on wire racks, and immediately brush down with simple syrup. Allow to cool for at least an hour before slicing and serving.",

    "raw_procedure": "Into the bowl of a stand mixer goes 250 grams of bread flour, 1 tsp active dry yeast, and 350 grams (12 \u00bc ounces) of water. Combine with a spatula into a paste. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 2-3 hours until it is bubbling. Set bowl in stand mixer with dough hook attachment. In a separate bowl, combine 400 grams bread flour, 25 grams granulated sugar, 25 grams of diastatic malt powder, and 10 grams kosher salt. Mix dry ingredients together. Start stand mixer at a low speed and add in the dry mix, one spoonful at a time, to create bagel dough. Once all dry ingredients have been added, let dough knead for 20 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in fridge for 20 minutes.\nWhile the dough is sitting, grease a half size sheet pan, line with parchment paper, and grease top of paper as well. Cut the dough and form into balls that weigh 65 grams. For the balls, tuck the dough underneath themselves, making them smooth and round. Cover with a damp towel in between formations because the dough develops a skin very quickly. Cover the balls with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for another 20 minutes.\nRemove from fridge and gently make a hole in the middle and stretch out by circling the middle with two fingers. Once all are in bagel form, cover again with plastic wrap, and let sit out for 20 minutes before putting in the fridge overnight for at least 24 hours.\nIn a large pot, pour in about 1 \u00bd gallons of water, 1 Tbsp barley syrup, and 2 tsp baking soda. After that has dissolved and the water is at a boil, put in bagels and boil for 60 seconds on each side. Then, flip onto cooling rack smooth side up to drain for about one minute. If you want to add a flavor to your bagels, now is the time to do it (see everything instructions below).\nThen put the bagels on a lightly greased parchment paper lined baking sheet and put in oven for 15 minutes at 425\u00b0F, rotating the tray once at 7 minutes and flipping the bagels once at 13 minutes.\nFor \u201ceverything\u201d seasoning, in a small bowl combine some onion granules, garlic flakes, white sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, and flaky Maldon salt. Add to desired number of bagels just after boiling and right before baking.",

    "raw_procedure": "In a food processor add: 14.66 ounces of bread flour, 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten, and 2 tsp of instant yeast. Pulse to combine.\nNext combine 9 ounces of cold water and 2 Tbsp of malt syrup in a bowl. Whisk to mix. Turn food processor on low and add the cold water and malt syrup mixture. Mix for about 20 seconds, stop, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it has rested for 10 minutes, add 2 tsp of salt. Turn the food processor on medium to high for about 90 seconds.\nRemove dough from food processor and knead for about a minute. Next, divide dough into 3.5 ounce pieces. Roll the pieces into tight balls and cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes. Once they have rested, decide which method you will use to turn your balls of dough into bagels. For the best tutorial, watch the episode to see the difference in the methods.\nOption 1 - Twist Method: Roll out a piece of dough with a rolling pin until it\u2019s roughly 5 inches across. Next, start from one end of the circle and start rolling the dough onto itself. Once it is rolled into a tight roll that is 9-10 inches long, it\u2019s time to twist the dough. Place one hand on each side of the dough roll and then roll the ends in opposite directions to create the \u201ctwist\u201d. Wrap the dough around your hand and then pinch the ends together. With the ring of dough still wrapped around your hand, roll the dough on your work surface to seal together.\nOption 2 - Punch Method: Take a ball of dough and place it on your work surface. Stick one finger into the center and shake the dough around your finger until a round hole forms. Pick up the dough and shape it with two fingers, coaxing it into a bagel shape. This method is easier, but doesn\u2019t yield as great of a bagel texture as the twist method.\nPlace the bagels on a baking sheet covered in cornmeal. Cover that with plastic wrap and let sit for an hour. Once they\u2019ve sat for an hour, place them in the fridge overnight or for 24 hours.\nBring water in a pot to a boil and add \u00bc cup of sugar and 1 Tbsp of baking soda. Add the bagels to the water and boil for about 20 seconds on each side.\nRemove and place them on a wire rimmed baking sheet, making sure the cornmeal side is down. If you\u2019d like to add toppings, now is the time to do it.\nAdd \u00bd cup of boiling water to the bottom of the pan and then place in the oven at 450\u00b0F for 20 to 25 minutes flipping them halfway through.\nLet cool, serve, and enjoy!",

There should be about 2 rows with 7 strips of prosciutto in each.\nGrab your tenderloin, cut off any kitchen string and brush tenderloin with English mustard.\nSpread an even layer of the mushroom duxelles on the prosciutto. Place the roast at the end of the prosciutto and duxelles wrapping. Use the plastic wrap to leverage the wrapping around the roast. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap to seal. Place in the fridge to firm up. Again, watch the video to see this done!\nPreheat oven to 450\u2109.\nGenerously flour your work surface before rolling out your puff pastry. Your puff pastry should be 3 inches wider than your roast and 12 inches longer.\nPlace plastic wrap on your work surface and place the dough on top. Grab your tenderloin from the fridge and unwrap. Place the tenderloin at the edge of the dough square.\nUsing the plastic wrap, roll the dough around the tenderloin and fold the edges down. Wrap the plastic wrap around the roast and then use Gordon Ramsay's Whipsy Flipsy method to seal the edges. Watch the video! Put it in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up.\nAfter firmed up, unwrap from plastic and place on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Brush the roast down with a beaten egg and use the back of a paring knife to decoratively score the dough. Sprinkle with flaky kosher salt.\nInsert a temperature probe into the thickest part of the roast. Bake at 450\u2109 until the roast registers as 120\u2109 internally. Let rest for 15 minutes and then slice open to reveal the fruits of your labor.",

Stir to combine and set aside for 10 minutes.\nIn a stand mixer bowl, combine 22 ounces of bread flour with \u00bd tsp of baking soda and \u00bd a tsp of kosher salt. Mix to combine before adding our milk and yeast mixture. Make sure your dough hook is attached and mix for about 3-4 minutes. You want the dough to be sticky.\nTransfer dough to a separate bowl. Cover and let sit for 1 hour.\nLiberally flour your work surface and turn out your dough onto the flour. Coat the dough with a nice thick layer of flour before rolling out to about \u00bc inch thick. Trim off the edges to make a nice big rectangle and then cut into smaller rectangles.\nPreheat your oil to 370\u00b0F and then add 3-5 pieces of dough to the oil. Be sure to baste the skyward facing side of the beignets constantly for about 2 minutes before flipping and letting cook for about 30 more seconds.\nRemove from oil and place on a plate that is lined with paper towels.\nDust them down with liberally with powdered sugar. Serve and enjoy!\nIf you want to make them like the beignets from The Princess and the Frog, add honey to them before you add your powdered sugar!",

Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let ferment at room temperature for at least 8 hours, up to 24 hours.\nCombine the biga with the remaining ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Mix for 1-2 minutes on medium speed, until the ingredients are homogenous.  Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook, and knead on medium-high speed for 10 minutes, until dough is shiny and smooth.  Pull the dough off the hook and pour into a large oiled bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, remove the plastic wrap, oil a rubber spatula, and fold the dough onto itself 8 times, rotating the bowl so every part of the dough gets turned.  Replace the plastic wrap, rest for an additional 30 minutes, and repeat the process 2 more times.\nPreheat oven to 450\u00b0F with a pizza stone set in the center of the oven.  Turn the dough out onto an extremely liberally-floured surface.  Divide into 3 equal pieces, and roughly shape each into a 12x9\u201d rectangle, flouring underneath if the dough sticks.  Fold the dough onto itself like a letter, resulting in a 12x3\u201d loaf.  Repeat with remaining pieces, and place each loaf on a sheet of parchment paper cut just larger than the size of the loaves.  Dust with flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for another 20 minutes.\nRemove the plastic wrap, spray down the loaves with water from a spray bottle, and slide onto the pizza stone.  Bake for 22-30 minutes, until deeply golden brown on the outside, registering 210\u00b0F inside.  Place on a wire rack and allow to cool completely before assembling the sandwich.",

Saute the bacon for 2-3 minutes. Once brown and all the fat is rendered out, remove the bacon from the pan and place on a plate covered in a paper towel to absorb any remaining fat.\nPlace seasoned chuck roast cubes into the remaining oil and bacon fat. Make sure not to overcrowd your beef. Cook until a nice golden brown on all sides and set aside on a plate covered with a paper towel.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F.\nAdd the onion and carrots to the saucepan. Saute in the remaining fat until softened. Remove from the pan and set aside.\nUsing the burgundy, deglaze and get all the yummy burnt stuff off the bottom of the pan. Set aside.\nPlace beef cubes into a dutch oven and toss with flour. Place in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes or until toasty. Remove from the oven and give them a little toss before returning to the oven for another 10 minutes.\nOnce again, remove from the oven. Reduce the oven\u2019s temperature to 325\u00b0F. Then, add vegetables, bacon, wine from the deglazed pan, and beef stock. Add garlic, thyme, bay leaf, and tomato paste. Mix and make sure everything is well incorporated.\nPlace in oven and allow to braise for about 3 hours. Stir occasionally. While in the oven, prepare your mushrooms and onions.\nPlace unpeeled pearl onions in a bowl. Cover in boiling water and then transfer onions to a bath of icy water to stop cooking. Pinch onion at stem and it should slip out of its skin. If not, remove skin with paring knife.\nIn a large skillet, heat vegetable oil and toss peeled onions around until browned. Leaving the onions in the skillet, deglaze with beef stock. Cover skillet with lid and allow the onions and beef stock to braise for about 45 minutes or until the onions are soft but still retain their shape.\nIn another skillet, heat butter over high heat. Place mushrooms in skillet and toss and shake for about 5 minutes. When the mushrooms have expelled most of their moisture, add thyme, salt and pepper. Continue to saut\u00e9 for 10 more minutes. Set aside.\nRemove dutch oven from oven. Using a pair of tongs, remove beef and place aside. Strain the liquid into a large saucepan.\nOver medium-high heat, aggressively reduce the liquid until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nPlace a few pieces of beef, a couple of carrots, a healthy pile of the onions, a little pile of mushrooms, and a little pile of onions on a plate. Top with some sauce and freshly chopped parsley. Dig in and prepare to have your pants blown off.",

Add 5 ounces of bread flour and whole wheat flour. Combine until a sloppy dough forms.\nCover the dough and allow to sit at room temperature for 5-16 hours. You can get some sleep in the meantime.\nAdd the rest of the bread flour, additional room temperature water, rye flour, and honey to the dough. Mix lightly by hand. Then, using a stand mixer with a kneading hook, allow dough to be kneaded for 15 minutes on a low speed.\nLightly oil a bowl. Dump the kneaded dough into the bowl, pat it down with your fingers, and cover. Allow dough to rise for 2 hours or until it has tripled in size.\nHeavily flour your workspace. Dump the dough out onto the workspace. Pull the edges into the center of the dough to create a smooth top for your bread.\nLine a colander with cheesecloth and dust cloth lightly with flour. Place dough smooth side down. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 45 minutes or until it has almost doubled in size.\nPreheat oven to 450\u00b0F and place a pizza stone into oven.\nLightly flour a parchment-lined pizza peel. Place pizza peel on top of the colander and invert so the dough is now lying on top of the parchment paper on the pizza peel.\nGet your razor blade from the Goodfellas pasta episode and score the bread. Spritz the dough with water.\nUsing the pizza peel, transfer the dough to the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Allow to bake for 35-45 minutes or until browned. Tap the outside of the loaf cause that seems like something you\u2019re supposed to do with bread. Allow the loaf to cool for at least 2 hours.",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by heating some milk in a bowl to 110\u00b0F and then add 1 tsp of sugar along with 1 packet of active dry yeast. Stir to combine and set aside for 10 minutes.\nIn a large bowl combine 350 grams of all purpose flour with 75 grams of white sugar, and 1 tsp of table salt. Whisk to combine.\nIn the same bowl, add 3 large egg yolks and the milk and yeast mixture. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix dough together until it forms a large shaggy mass. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8 minutes. Once dough is smooth, add to an oiled bowl, cover, and let sit for about an hour or until it\u2019s doubled in size.\nWhile the dough is proofing, add 100g of almond flour to a food processor along with 150g of powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp of corn syrup and a little bit of green and black food coloring. Turn the food processor on and slowly add 2 Tbsp of water. Add more if needed.\nKnead until the color is uniform and then wrap and place in the fridge for 1 hour.\nTurn dough out onto a floured work surface, pat with a little bit of flour, and then roll out to about \u00bd inch thickness. Cut the dough into a large rectangle, and then cut the dough into triangles.\nHeat up vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet to 375\u00b0F.\nAdd donuts to the oil and flip constantly while they cook. Once brown, remove from oil and place on a wire rack to let cool.\nOnce cooled, use a paring knife make an entry point into the side of the donut and add your jelly with a piping bag. Once the jelly is added, coat the whole donut in glaze and then immediately place in a bowl with coconut shavings. Toss until fully coated.\nRoll out the marzipan into a very thin sheet and then cut into small rectangular strips. Add some glaze to the marzipan to help it stick to the donut, and then stick the marzipan to the donut.\nServe and enjoy!",

Give them a little chop or mash them with a fork and set aside.\nFor the rice, start by rinsing the rice multiple times to remove the stach. The first couple times you wash it, it\u2019ll be very cloudy. Continue to wash until it almost runs clear.\nAdd rice to a rice cooker or pressure cooker along with 1\u00bd cups of water.

    "raw_procedure": "Place your meat grinder parts in the freezer to begin freezing up. You want them to freeze for about an hour.\nStart by removing bones and silver skin from your brisket, sirloin, and short rib. Slice meat into one inch strips and then cut crosswise into 1-2 inch chunks.\nPlace all the meat on a parchment lined baking sheet and put in the freezer and freeze for 15-20 minutes.\nWhile meat is freezing, prepare all of your toppings. Slice your tomatoes and onions, and chop up your lettuce. You can put any toppings you want, because it\u2019s your burger!\nFor the special sauce, combine equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise with a good sprinkling of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika, followed by a hearty helping of sweet relish. Mix to combine.\nRemove meat and meat grinder parts from freezer. Assemble your meat grinder and start feeding your meat into the grinder. When you\u2019ve fed all of your meat through, you should have some pebbly ground beef.\nForm into 4-5 inch pucks (or whatever size you\u2019d like). Season with salt and pepper, and let rest in the fridge.\nButter your buns and place them on a hot skillet to toast your buns. Remove them from skillet when golden brown and set aside.\nHeat up your skillet or pan to medium high heat and add some vegetable oil. Place your burger on the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes and then flip. Once you flip, add your american cheese to the burger. Add about 1 Tbsp water to the skillet and then cover. This allows the cheese to melt and the burger to cook more evenly. When internal temperature of burger reaches your desired level of doneness, remove from skillet.\nAssemble burger to your linking. I recommend bun, lettuce, patty, onion, tomato, then bun with special sauce. Serve and enjoy!",

Lay out on a floured work surface and place small dollops of the butternut squash mixture every inch or so.\nWet the area around each dollop of filling and then fold the top half of the pasta over the bottom half of the pasta.

Add some fresh sage at the end of the browning and remove once wilted and crisp.\nCook your ravioli in boiling water for 3-5 minutes and then once cooked, strain and add directly to the browned butter still in the pan (but off of the heat). Keep stirring until the pasta sauce comes together and sticks to the ravioli.\nPut on a plate, top with grated parmesan, and drizzle with some balsamic reduction. Add your crispy sage leaves for flavor and presentation.\nServe and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Trim a butternut squash and cut it in half lengthwise. Scoop out the insides from the cavity.\nPlace squash on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and rub all over the flesh of the squash. Put some fresh sage into the cavity of each half of squash. Lastly, sprinkle with salt and pepper and flip the squash over so it is cut-side down on the baking sheet.\nBake at 350\u00b0F for 45-60 minutes, or until a paring knife shows little to no resistance when pierced through the flesh.\nScoop out all of the squash flesh and place it into a blender, but reserve 1 cup of the flesh for later.\nAdd some chicken stock to the blender, just enough to help make it into a puree. Add a little, blend, and check for consistency. Add chicken stock until puree consistency is reached.\nIn a stock pot, sweat a small onion in some olive oil over medium heat.\nAdd 1 cup of rice (arborio or carnaroli) and stir. Deglaze the pan with a glug or two of dry white wine.\nSimmer over high heat until the smell of alcohol has cooked off, stirring constantly.\nNow it\u2019s time to slowly start adding the chicken stock. You should have the chicken stock gently simmering in a different pot. Add a couple ladles at a time and stir constantly. Once you are able to drag your spoon across the bottom of the pot and it leaves a trail of exposed pot behind it, add 2 or 3 more ladles of hot chicken stock. Keep repeating this process of adding stock and stirring until you can see the bottom of the pot when scraped, all while keeping the pot at a medium simmer. Do this until the rice is almost fully cooked (toothsome).\nNext, add the butternut squash puree and stir to combine. Continue to cook over medium-low heat until the rice is complete.\nIn a separate pan, fry sage leaves in some butter until the butter starts to turn brown. Once you see the milk fats start to solidify and darken, remove the pan from the heat and pour the butter into a container to cool. Remove the fried sage leaves and set aside.\nAdd a few tablespoons of maple syrup to the risotto along with a little bit of the browned butter. Also grate in a lot of parmesan and stir until everything is melted.\nRoughly chop your reserved butternut squash flesh and add it to the pot for some texture. Stir and season with kosher salt and white pepper.\nPlate the risotto in a bowl. Top it with some more browned butter and then top it with some chopped (cooked) bacon. Next, add some parmesan shavings to the bowl. Lastly, top it off with some of the fried sage leaves.",

    "raw_procedure": "Slice an eggplant and place the slices on a rack set and rimmed baking sheet and season both sides with some light sprinklings of kosher salt.\nAfter about 30 minutes, you will begin to notice that a brown liquid has materialized on top of the eggplant slices. Use a paper towel to dab the liquid off of both sides of the eggplant slices.\nLine a sheet pan with aluminum foil and place the rack of eggplant slices on top. Season the slices with a little bit of freshly ground black pepper and a few healthy glugs of olive oil for flavor and coloring. Place in a 400\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until the slices are nicely browned and soft. Set aside to cool off.\nOnce the eggplant slices are cooled off, chop them into smaller pieces.\nTo your cold fermented dough, add a generous amount of ricotta cheese and spread it out. Make sure to leave a 2 to 3 inch gap on the outside. Then, add some pepperonis as well as your chopped roasted eggplant slices. To top everything off, add some thinly sliced mozzarella cheese.\nFold the dough over while trying to drape instead of stretch. Seal the dough shut and use a pizza cutter to trim off the excess dough. Pinch the edge shut to make sure that it is completely sealed and tuck in the calzone tips to make sure it will fit on the pizza peel.\nDust the pizza peel with ground cornmeal and place the calzone on top and make any last minute adjustments. Make sure that the thicker part of the calzone is facing the hotter part of the oven.\nPlace into the oven (after it has been maxed out and preheating for one hour) between the two pizza stones for 5 to 15 minutes. Once it is finished, immediately slice the calzone in half to prevent the steam from making the crust soggy from the inside out.\nTo reduce the moisture inside of your calzone, line a sieve with four layers of cheesecloth and set into a bowl. Dump in your ricotta cheese, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and drain overnight. Alternatively, you could weigh everything down with something heavy and let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Use shredded full fat low moisture mozzarella cheese, layer the other toppings, and fold using the same method as before. Place into the oven (after it has been maxed out and preheating for one hour) between the two pizza stones for 5 to 15 minutes. Once it is finished, immediately slice the calzone in half to prevent the steam from making the crust soggy from the inside out.",

Let it bloom for 10 minutes before adding 600 grams of bread flour to give the dough a hydration of about 60%. Next, add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and knead on medium speed for about 5 minutes.\nPre-divide the dough into your desired portions. Since we are making calzones, make sure that you are using a double portion of dough. Then, stretch each divided portion into a taut ball. The rounder and more taut the ball is, the easier everything will be later on. Place each portion of dough into individual well-oiled bowls, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 days.\nFor cold fermented pizza dough, allow your pre-made dough to proof at room temperature for two hours. Start by generously flouring the dough as well as your work surface.\nRoll out the two ends of the dough and leave a sort of mound of unrolled dough in the middle, which you can then rotate and roll from the center. Pass the dough repeatedly over your knuckles until gravity stretches it out to about a 10-inch round.\nPrep your pizza peel by dusting it with a bit of coarsely ground cornmeal, which is going to allow the pizza to slide off into the oven with ease.

    "raw_procedure": "Start by putting your whole milk ricotta in a fine mesh sieve and placing it over a bowl to let the moisture drain from the ricotta. Place in fridge to drain and stay cool for one hour.\nIn a food processor combine 250g of all purpose flour, 30g of sifted powdered sugar, 2 tsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, and \u00bd tsp of instant espresso. Pulse to combine before adding 30ml each of Marsala wine and white wine vinegar.\nOnce mixture is nice and sandy, add 2 Tbsp of butter and one whole egg, and mix for about 45 seconds or until a rough ball of dough forms.\nPlace dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for 2-5 minutes until it becomes silky and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for one hour.\nNext, take your cannoli molds and grease them up by spraying them down with Pam, or coating in vegetable oil.\nRemove dough from fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface until it\u2019s about 1/16 of an inch thick (or just really thin). Using a 4-inch wide biscuit cutter, cut rounds out of the rolled out dough and cover them with plastic wrap (just lay plastic wrap over them on the counter).\nTake your dough round, place the cannoli mold into the center and lightly put some egg white on one side of the dough and place the egg white side over the other to seal it.\nGet your lard into a pot and heat it to 390\u00b0F, and gently place your cannolis in. Let them fry for 2-4 minutes or until golden brown, and flipping once if possible. Drain on a wire rack.\nRemove ricotta from the fridge and using a spoon or a spatula, press down on the ricotta to help drain as much moisture as you can. Then in your mixing bowl, press the ricotta through the sieve using a rubber spatula. Add 125 grams of sifted powdered sugar and \u00bd tsp of ground cinnamon. Attach your whisk attachment, and whisk together your cannoli cream. Place cannoli cream into a piping bag.\nNow that the pastry shells have cooled off, remove them from their molds.\nMelt some milk chocolate (or chocolate of your choice) and dip the ends of the cannoli into the chocolate and let them harden in the fridge for 15 minutes.\nRemove from the fridge and fill shells with cannoli cream. Decorate them however you like. I used chocolate chips on some and finely chopped pistachios on others. Top all with some powdered sugar. Serve and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by dicing \u00bd pound guanciale or pancetta. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl or measuring cup, combine 3 large eggs and 1 egg yolk.\nGrate and measure out 4 ounces of cheese - I recommend Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano or a blend of the two.\nCombine grated cheese and eggs and beat together with a fork until homogenous.\nSeason the egg and cheese mixture with fresh black pepper. Do not add salt yet, because the guanciale brings a lot of salt to the dish. Beat until well incorporated.\nAdd the diced guanciale to a cold pan and then turn the heat to medium. This will allow the fat to render out slowly. Once it is fully cooked but not too crispy, turn off the heat.\nAdd your noodles to a large pot of heavily salted water. Cook until they are to your desired texture.\nAdd the cooked noodles to the pan with the guanciale. Toss to coat the noodles in the guanciale fat.\nWork quickly to add the egg and cheese mixture to the pan and mix rigorously. This will help to emulsify the sauce and make it creamy. If it\u2019s as smooth as you\u2019d like, you can add a little bit of pasta water (about \u00bc cup). Season with salt if it needs it.\nPlate up and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by stemming and seeding some dried pasilla, guajillo, and ancho chilis. Save a few tablespoons of the seeds.\nHeat a cast iron skillet to a medium heat and add chilis. Dry roast them for about 2 minutes. Place about 12 chilis into a blender and set aside. Remove any extra chilis from skillet.\nIn the same skillet add 1 tsp whole cloves, 1 tsp peppercorns, 3 crumbled bay leaves, 1 cinnamon stick broken into a few pieces, and some of our reserved chili seeds. Dry roast for about 2 minutes or until the seeds darken. Remove from skillet and add to the blender.\nAdd one corn tortilla that has been torn into smaller pieces to the skillet cook with a little bit of oil until they turn brown. Add them to the blender.\nToast 1 piece of white bread and add that to the blender.\nAdd some vegetable oil to the pan along with \u2153 cup each of peanuts, pumpkin seeds, almonds and raisins. Roast for about one minute before adding \u00bc cup of sesame seeds. Let it go for one more minute before placing all of it into the blender.\nAdd some oil to the skillet and turn to a medium high heat. Add 1 large quartered tomato, 1 large chopped onion, and 4 cloves of garlic (If you have tomatillos this is the time to add them). Let them sit undisturbed for about a minute, letting them get nice and brown. Add \u00bc tsp each of dried thyme, marjoram, and aniseed. Cook for about a minute and then add to the blender.\nHeat up 4 cups of chicken stock and add that to the blender. Let everything sit in the blender for 10 minutes. Blend on medium for about 2 minutes or until smooth.\nAdd blended sauce to a large saucepan and cook on medium-low heat for about an hour.\nRun the sauce through a mesh sieve until you have a thick paste in the sieve and a smooth puree below.\nAdd the puree back to saucepan on a medium heat and add 4 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate. Taste and add sugar if necessary.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Place a small handful of cheddar cheese in six piles on a cookie sheet lined with a silicon mat or parchment paper. Bake the cheese for about 10 minutes, checking constantly just until all cheese is melted and edges begin to brown. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Transfer crisps to a wire rack to cool.\nIn a blender combine 5 ounces of goat cheese with 1 Tbsp of honey and 2 Tbsp of heavy cream. Blend on high speed until you have a thick spreadable cream.\nIn a skillet cook up one piece of chorizo until your preferred doneness. Cut into 4 pieces.\nButter both slices of bread on the outside. On one piece of bread, slather some mole, top with cooked chorizo sausages, cheese crisps, and goat cheese cream. Top with other piece of bread. Place into your panini press/George Foreman grill.

    "raw_procedure": "Peel off all of the green parts from the top of the cauliflower and slice it in half. To remove the core, take a knife and cut around the top, bottom, and sides of the core and peel it right out. Set aside the core to cook separately later.\nSeparate the cauliflower into individual florets by cutting it into thick pieces. This will make it easier to trim out the stems of the cauliflower. Then, separate the florets by breaking them up by hand until you end up with bite-sized pieces. Set aside the stems to cook separately with the core later.\nBlend the cauliflower florets and ensure that every individual piece is being chopped up in between pulses. Blend until you end up with a fine porridge-like texture that is not too smooth.\nTo get the most possible moisture out of the cauliflower, cook it in a shallow wide saut\u00e9 pan until it is soft and dry. Dump the cooked cauliflower out onto some paper towels and spread it out until it is flat and allow as much steam to escape as possible. Allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\nOnce the cauliflower is cool, continue to get the moisture out firmly pressing the surface with paper towels. After placing the crust into a large mixing bowl, add 2 eggs, 2 ounces of low-moisture hand-shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1 ounce of finely grated parmesan. Mix to combine.\nDump the crust onto a parchment lined baking sheet and form it into two rough individual pizzas. Par bake in a 400\u00b0F oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they are golden brown.\nFor the pizza sauce, use a blender to combine, 1 14 \u00bd ounce can of chopped tomatoes, a few sprinkles each of dry basil and dry oregano, 1 clove of garlic, 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped onion, and a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Gently and quickly pulse a few times until the sauce is slightly smooth but still chunky.\nFor seasoning, add kosher salt along with any other spices or seasonings of your choice. Pulse to fully combine.\nTop the cauliflower crust off with a thin and even layer of your pizza sauce and a healthy portion of grated mozzarella cheese and an optional portion of pepperoni. Place the pizzas back into the oven for another 8 to 12 minutes. Add fresh parmesan and basil if desired.\nAllow the pizzas to cool off for 5 to 10 minutes before attempting to remove them from the parchment paper. Slice the pizza as desired and enjoy.",

Mix to combine.\nIn a bag add your pork belly along with your sauce mixture. Close the bag and mix everything together. Place on a plate and let sit in the fridge for 24 hours.\nIn a mixing bowl combine all purpose flour along with the white sugar, yeast, whole milk, and vegetable oil. Mix to combine until dough forms. Remove dough from the mixing bowl and then coat mixing bowl with oil and place the dough back in. Cover and let rest for 2 hours.\nIn a small bowl combine oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, Chinese five spice powder, soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, and fermented red bean paste. Whisk to combine, and then divide in half.\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with foil and then add a wire rack on top and lightly coat with oil. Place pork on the wire rack and brush the top with some of your divided sauce.\nPlace pork in a 450\u00b0 F oven for about 10 minutes. Remove, flip the pork, and brush down again with sauce. Repeat until internal temperature reaches 180\u00b0F and the outside is nicely caramelized and charred.\nLet cook for 5 minutes and then chop the pork belly into small pieces and then combine with the rest of the divided sauce. Mix to combine.\nOnce your dough has risen, dust your countertop with flour and roll out the dough into a long rope using the windmill technique.\nCut the dough into half-inch pieces and roll out to form wrappers.\nAdd \u00bd Tbsp of filling into the center of the wrapper. Carefully pinch and fold the wrapper closed, twisting the top to finish. Make sure to press the dough tight to seal the top.\nBring a pot of water to a boil. Place the baos in a steam basket lined with cabbage leaves (or parchment paper coated with some oil) and place the basket on top of the boiling pot of water. Close the lid and let steam for 15 minutes, then turn off the heat and let the baos rest for 5 minutes.\nServe and enjoy!",

Using a wooden spoon or preferably a whisk, mix together until the consistency is similar to wet sand.\nWithin 30 seconds, the roux should be the color of milk chocolate. The darker the roux gets, the more you need to stir it, but let it sit for a few seconds before continuing to stir. After about 5-6 minutes, the color of the roux should be nice and dark or similar to the color of a Hershey\u2019s chocolate bar. Set aside some of the roux to use later.\nAdd 2 bay leaves as well as your \u201choly trinity\u201d to the pot. Make sure to set aside some of the holy trinity mix for later.\nOnce the mixture calms down a bit, add the minced garlic to the pot. Let the roux sit for 30 seconds.\nAdd 8 ounces of beer and stir it in and whisk to prevent the mixture from becoming clumpy. Then, add 4 cups of chicken stock and whisk using the same procedure as the beer.\nTake 1 lb of andouille sausage or smoked kielbasa and cut into coins.\nAdd kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to both sides of 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Sear the chicken thighs in a smoking hot pan with oil.\nAdd 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt to the roux.\nTurn the stovetop temperature to the lowest simmer possible and add a generous amount of black pepper to the roux. Then, add 1 tbsp of smoked paprika and stir.\nAfter browning the chicken, add it straight to the pot and set aside the remaining oil from the chicken. Next, add the chopped up sausage or smoked kielbasa to the pot.\nBring the roux to a bare simmer, cover it, and let sit for a couple of hours.\nServe with cooked white rice, garnish with scallions, and enjoy!",

This helps keep your gluten down.\nAdd your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.\nOptional: You can toast some nuts and add those to your cookie dough as well.\nRoll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet. This will help give the cookies a rustic look. Bake in a 350\u00b0F oven for 12-17 minutes or until they\u2019ve reached your preferred doneness. Top with a little bit of sea salt.\nLet cool for a few minutes, serve and enjoy.",

Beat the eggs together until they are light and frothy, and then add 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 2 Tbsp of Grand Marnier.\nOnce that\u2019s combined, SLOWLY add the chocolate mixture to egg and brown sugar mixture, and whisk to combine.\nNow add 6 Tbsp of all purpose flour and stir to combine.\nButter some ramekins and coat the inside with raw sugar. This will help get the cakes out of the ramekins.\nFill each ramekin a little under halfway with your cake mixture.\nRemove the chocolate ganache from the freezer and place 1-2 Tbsp into the center of the cake mixture. Fill ramekins the rest of the cake batter.\nPreheat your oven to 425\u00b0 F and bake for 11 minutes.\nWhile that\u2019s baking quarter some strawberries and set aside.\nRemove cake ramekins from oven and place on a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge of each cake to help release them from their ramekin.\nPlace a plate on top of the ramekin, flip over so the ramekin is on top, and slowly lift up to make sure the cake is in tact.\nPlate with some whipped cream, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, strawberries and blueberries.\nServe and enjoy!",

Use a ramekin to get it into the edges (see video for example).\nPar-bake in the oven for about 8 minutes at 350\u00b0F.\nWhile the crust is par-baking, start on the filling by combining 1 \u00bc cups of heavy cream along with 1 tsp each of instant espresso powder, allspice, and cinnamon in a small pot on a medium heat and bring to a bare simmer.\nChop 9 ounces of high quality chocolate, place in a bowl, and combine with heavy cream mixture. SLOWLY mix so you don\u2019t get air bubbles and once combined add 4 Tbsp of unsalted butter that\u2019s cut into small pieces. Once it\u2019s cooled a little, add 2 large lightly beaten eggs and slowly mix to combine.\nRemove pie crust from oven and top with chocolate mixture. Use a skewer to pop any air bubbles that rise to the top.\nPlace in a 250\u00b0F oven for 30-35 minutes until jiggly but set.\nFor the glaze to hold the strawberries in place, combine 3 Tbsp of hot butter with 2 ounces of chopped chocolate in a bowl and cover with foil for 30 seconds. Uncover and whisk to combine. Add 1 Tbsp of hot water and whisk in slowly.\nSpread glaze over the top, and top that with your chopped strawberries.\nCut, serve, and enjoy!",

Flour first, then the wet batter, then the coconut/panko mixture. Repeat until all of the shrimp has been breaded. Make sure to press hard into the coconut breading to make sure enough coconut gets stuck to the shrimp.\nPlace into a fryer with peanut oil heated between 325-350\u00b0F.\nCook for only 2 minutes until they are nice and crispy brown.\nPlace onto a plate and hit them with a little kosher salt while they are still hot.\nPlate them and serve them with some sort of dipping sauce, and enjoy.",

    "raw_procedure": "Cut a small \u201cX\u201d into the bottom of 4 of the roma tomatoes, and prepare both a pot of boiling water and a large bowl of ice water.  Blanch the tomatoes for less than one minute, until cuts just begin to split up the sides of the tomatoes.  Remove immediately and place in the ice bath, and allow to cool completely.  Set aside.\nSet a large stovetop gas burner to high, and place two bell peppers directly on the grate over the flame.  Allow to char completely before flipping, and blackening on all sides.  Remove from heat and cover with tin foil for about 5 minutes, until softened.  Peel off skins and place in a high-powered blender or food processor, along with remaining tomatoes, the picked leaves of one rosemary sprig, thyme, garlic, onion, vegetable stock, water, and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Blend on high speed until completely smooth.\nPreheat oven to 225\u00b0F.  Using a very sharp knife, cut tomatoes into 1/8-inch thick slices, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Using a mandolin, slice squash and eggplants into 1/8-inch thick slices, and stack on the baking sheet.  In a shallow roaster or casserole, pour a thin layer of the roast pepper mixture, and spread evenly.  Begin shingling vegetables on top: eggplant, followed by tomato, yellow squash, and green squash - continuing the pattern around the edge of the roaster, letting each slice stick out less than 1/4-inch from underneath the following slice.  Once the outside of the roaster has been lined with vegetables, repeat another layer inside, and continue until roaster is filled with patterned vegetables.  Finely chop remaining rosemary, and sprinkle over top with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to the size of the roaster, place on top of vegetables.  Roast for 90 minutes, removing the parchment paper during the final 20 minutes of cooking.\nOnce vegetables are completely softened but still hold their shape, remove from the oven.  Place a ring mold in the center of a large plate, and fill widthwise with vegetables stacked vertically.  Place a layer of vegetables staggered horizontally over top, and slowly remove ring mold.  Combine 1 tablespoon of the red pepper sauce from the bottom of the roaster with remaining olive oil, and drizzle in a circle around the outside of the vegetable stack.  Garnish with torn parsley and serve.",

While that is cooking, chop your carrot, celery, garlic, and onion. Set aside.\nOnce the bacon is cooked, remove from the pan, and then add your chicken, skin side down. Cook until golden brown and crisp, then flip to the other side.\nWhile cooking, drizzle chicken with some E&J brandy and then VERY CAREFULLY flambe the chicken and then put out the flame by covering with a lid.\nOnce fire is out, remove chicken and deglaze the pan with 1 \u00bc cups of chicken broth and \u00bd a bottle of a dry full bodied red wine. Scrape up all the fond off of the bottom, bring to a simmer and add \u00bd a chopped onion, 1 chopped carrot, 1 chopped stalk of celery, and 3 chopped cloves of garlic.\nAdd 1 can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Mix to combine before adding 2 tsp of thyme and 2 tsp of rosemary. Mix to combine and break up the tomatoes into bite sized pieces.\nAdd chicken back into pan leaving them half submerged in the braising liquid, along with your cooked chopped bacon. Mix to combine.\nAfter 30 minutes, turn the chicken pieces and then 30 minutes after that, turn again.\nAdd a punch of salt. (It\u2019s really just a pinch).\nCook some egg noodles and toss with butter, salt, and pepper.\nIn a bowl add your egg noodles along with some chicken and broth and top with some freshly chopped parsley.\nServe and enjoy!",

Gently paddle to combine until you end up with a pancake batter consistency.\nUsing the same cast iron skillet that is still lubed up with about 1 tablespoon of the brown butter, add the cornbread batter and smooth it out on the top. Place the skillet into a 425\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until deep golden brown around the edges.\nEnsure that the cornbread is cooked by using a toothpick and making sure that there are only a few moist crumbs remaining on the toothpick. After allowing the cornbread to cool in the skillet for about 5 to 10 minutes, give it a drizzle of honey and brush it on for even coverage to create a shiny and sticky glaze. Then, give it a sprinkling of flaky sea salt.\nCarefully remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving while it is still warm.",

    "raw_procedure": "In a mixing bowl, combine 5 ounces of finely ground cornmeal and 5 ounces of all-purpose flour. Add \u00bd a teaspoon of baking powder, \u00bd a teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and \u00bd a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Whisk together accordingly. Next, add 4 ounces of grated cheddar cheese and toss to coat with the dry ingredients so that nothing sticks together.\nUse a food processor to pulse together \u00bd a cup of fresh corn kernels, 1 \u00bd cups of buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons of honey or sweetener of choice. Then, add 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper that is cored and quartered. Give it 6 to 8 pulses until the jalape\u00f1o is nicely chopped.\nNext, add 2 large eggs as well as 1 stick of melted butter that is completely cooled off to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pulse 4 to 5 times to combine.\nTake your mixing bowl of dry ingredients and dig a well in the center. Pour in your wet mixture from the food processor and gently mix together with a paddle. If the batter is over mixed, it can become tough.\nCoat a cast iron skillet with butter and carefully add your cornbread batter. Smooth out the top of the batter and garnish with a few slices of jalape\u00f1o pepper. Place the skillet into a 425 degree-Fahrenheit oven for 20 to 25 minutes.\nEnsure that the cornbread is cooked by using a toothpick and making sure that there are only a few moist crumbs remaining on the toothpick. After allowing the cornbread to cool in the skillet for about 5 to 10 minutes, give it a drizzle of honey and brush it on for even coverage to create a shiny and sticky glaze. Then, give it a sprinkling of flaky sea salt.\nCarefully remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving while it is still warm.",

Cut up the spines into manageable pieces and brown them in a stock pot before adding all additional aromatics.\nAdd cold water and bring to a bare simmer and let cook for a solid 2-3 hours until a very flavorful stock forms. Strain into a separate container.\nSpray down the hens with nonstick spray on both sides.\nPreheat oven to 500\u00b0 Fahrenheit with an aluminum sheet pan inside it. Once preheated, place the birds skin side down on the pan.

Add flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon over medium-low heat until dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool 1 minute before adding eggs and stirring until homogenous.\nFill pastry bag with choux dough and on a silicone baking sheet or parchment paper, pipe 1/2\u201d, 1\u201d, and 1 1/2\u201d rounds of dough.  Bake at 400\u00b0F for 15-20 minutes, or until risen and golden.

In a saucepan over medium-low heat, heat 2 cups of the milk until steaming.  Add the chocolate and whisk until completely incorporated - do not allow to boil.  Whisking constantly, pour half the chocolate mixture into the flour and egg mixture, beating until fully incorporated.  Return this mixture to the remaining milk and chocolate in the saucepan, and stir over low heat until thickened.  Refrigerate until cooled completely.\nMake the icings: In a medium bowl, whisk confectioners sugar while slowly pouring in milk, until a thin glaze is formed.  Divide into 3 smaller bowls, and color with purple, green, and pink food colorings.\nIn another medium bowl, combine remaining confectioner\u2019s sugar, butter, and 1 tablespoon milk.  With an electric hand mixer running, slowly drizzle in more milk until a thick frosting is formed.  Color with blue food coloring.\nAssemble the Courtesan au Chocolat: Using a small knife, cut a hole in the bottom of each choux ball.  Pipe the choux full of cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, and dip the top of the choux in the different colored glazes - purple for the largest, green for the medium-sized, and pink for the smallest.\nIn a double boiler, melt white chocolate completely, and allow to cool until handleable.  Combine with yellow food coloring, and using a very small pastry bag tip, pipe a filigree of white chocolate on each choux ball.\nPipe a dollop of blue frosting on the center of a large choux ball, and top with the medium, repeating with the smallest.

Combine orange juice, water, rice wine vinegar, rum, salt, brown sugar, garlic, oregano, rosemary, thyme, sage, and bay leaves in a large bowl - whisk to combine.  Place the pork shoulder in a large stainless steel bowl, and pour marinade over top, making sure it\u2019s completely submerged.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.\nTo make mojo marinade: combine olive oil, orange juice & zest, lime juice & peels, oregano, cilantro, mint, garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin, whisking to combine.\nRemove pork shoulder from brine and discard brine.  Place pork shoulder back into stainless steel bowl, and cover with mojo marinade.  Massage marinade into the pork for one minute before covering and refrigerating for 2 hours.\nRemove pork from the marinade, brushing off any large pieces of herbs.  Place on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, brush with marinade, and roast at 350\u00b0F for 2 1/2 hours, until pork registers 165\u00b0F at its thickest point.  Tent the roast with foil and allow to rest for 30 minutes, or refrigerate until ready to use.\nButter the inside of the pan Cubano, cut into 4 pieces, and toast butter-side-down in a hot plancha.  Slice pork about 1/4-inch thick.  In a lightly oiled nonstick pan, sear pork and ham.  Fill sandwiches with pork, ham, cheese, and pickles - smear with mustard, smear top exterior of the pan Cubano with butter, and press in the plancha for 2-3 minutes, until bread is deeply browned and cheese is melted.

    "raw_procedure": "Start by measuring out 250 grams each of bread flour and 00 Italian flour followed by 2 tsp of active yeast and whisk together.\nAdd 8 grams of kosher salt, and again whisk together.\nAdd exactly 325 mL of tap water (Creating a 60% hydration dough).\nUsing a wooden spoon, mix together until a shaggy ball forms. At this point, bravely pour out onto an un-floured countertop.\nGet to kneading until the dough has formed into a semi-smooth mass. Try to resist adding flour or water, if you can. If it\u2019s too sticky, try the slap and fold method. If it\u2019s too dry, just keep working it. Knead it until no more dry clumps of flour remain.\nFerment at room temperature for 8-24 hours. Lightly oil a nice big bowl because this will double in size. Drop the dough into the bowl, cover and let sit for 8-24 hours (my crust sat for 12 hours).\nOnce finished fermenting, oil a few proofing bowls with olive or vegetable oil.\nThen scrape your dough out onto a generously oiled countertop (make sure the countertop is oiled, or the dough will stick!). Make sure that your hands are also generously oiled or the dough will stick to your hands.\nKnead a little bit to get some of the dough out and then divide into 4 pieces for its long cold proof in the fridge.\nForm the four pieces into balls by taking the top and tucking underneath to form a nice smooth ball.\nTop each ball of dough with oil and then cover with plastic before placing into the fridge for 3 whole days.\nOnce the dough has risen, scrape out onto a generously floured countertop, flattening out into a nice circle, and rolling out via wine/whiskey bottle or roller.\nUse your knuckles, turning hand over hand, until the dough has been stretched out - leaving a little extra dough on the outside to form our crust.\nSprinkle corn flour or semolina flour down on pizza peel, then place the crust on top. This will help the pizza roll around freely, allowing us to easily slide it off the pizza steel.\nBuild the pizza by spreading tomato sauce on top, followed by a healthy layer of freshly shredded mozzarella cheese (don\u2019t use pre-shredded mozzarella. It is coated in potato starch and will result in nasty, not even melted mozzarella cheese).\nEvenly spread out the freshly sliced olives and pineapple.\nTop with a little freshly shredded parmesan cheese to keep the toppings in place.\nPreheat the oven to 550\u00b0F for 1 hour.\nPlace the pizza peel with pizza into the oven and let the pizza cook for 8 minutes.\nEnjoy!",

Once they are browned, finish the cooking by adding them to a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and bake at 375\u00b0F for about 20 minutes.\nSlice your submarine roll in half lengthwise and then add a layer of sauce and top that with a row of deli ham. Next, add your meatballs and then the other half of the sandwich bread.\nServe and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Into a stand mixer bowl, add 1 packet (2 \u00bc teaspoons) of active dry yeast and a teaspoon of sugar to 8 \u00bc ounces of room temperature water. Let bloom for 10 minutes until foamy. In a separate bowl, whisk together 12 \u00bd ounces of all-purpose flour, 2 \u00bd ounces of medium grind cornmeal, 1 \u00bd teaspoons of kosher salt, and \u215b teaspoon of cream of tartar. Pour dry ingredients into yeast mixture. Then add \u2153 cup plus 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.\nUsing a dough hook, stir the mixture on low speed for 1-2 minutes until dough is off the side of the bowl. Then, put speed to medium for 7-8 minutes to knead until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too hydrated, lightly flour a cooking surface and knead by hand for an additional 1-2 minutes until consistency is soft and tacky, but not sticky.\nStretch dough into a ball and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, tossing to make sure it\u2019s fully covered in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and sit out at room temperature for 60-90 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.\nLubricate a 12-inch cast iron skillet with vegetable oil. Grease your hands and coax the dough out of the bowl and into the pan. Push into the shape of a pizza by stretching and pushing the dough up to the sides of the pan. Let rest under cover of plastic wrap for 20-30 minutes. While this rests, you can start your tomato sauce (see recipe above).\nPress dough to sides of the pan, and it should easily hold its shape. Optional: Lay down a layer of raw mild Italian sausage into a nice even layer before the cheese.\nPlace a layer of deli-style sliced Provolone cheese on top next, then follow with a thick layer of low moisture mozzarella. More cheese = more cheese stretch!\nGenerously top cheese with tomato sauce until cheese is hidden. Then, sprinkle pre-grated parmesan on the sauce and drizzle olive oil on both the sauce and around the edge of the crust.\nPut into 425\u00b0F oven for 25-35 minutes, rotating once during baking until cooked through. Run a thin spatula around the outside edge to make sure that there\u2019s no sticking. Slide pizza out the pan and wait at least 10 minutes before cutting and serving pizza. Enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine warmed milk, active dry yeast, sugar, and honey. Whisk and let sit for 10 minutes.\nLightly beat 3 eggs and add to the stand mixer bowl along with the flour.\nCut butter into cubes and add to the stand mixer.\nUsing the dough hook, slowly beat the dough for a minute or two, then increase the speed to medium high and let it mix for 6 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl halfway through the 6 minutes.\nScrape down the sides one last time and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it rise at room temperature for one hour.\nWhile the dough is rising, prepare your apples. Peel all 4 apples and then dice into half-inch, bite sized cubes.\nToss the apple cubes in a bowl with the juice of one lemon.\nIn a large nonstick pan, melt \u00bd stick of unsalted butter over medium heat to lightly brown it.\nOnce you see the milk fats start to separate and change colors, add the cubed apples. Stir. Add the brown sugar and stir again.\nAdd the spices (cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and allspice) and stir to combine. Simmer, tossing occasionally, for 4-5 minutes.\nMix \u00bc cup warm water with 1 tsp cornstarch. Pour the slurry into the apples to thicken up. Stir and cook for an additional minute and then set aside.\nGenerously flour your work surface. Scrape every last bit of dough out of the bowl and onto your floured counter.\nCoax the dough into a rectangle, stretching and patting it. Dump the cooled (yes, cooled) apples onto the top of the rectangle. Spread them across the dough evenly.\nFold the dough on top of itself into thirds, like a pamphlet. This laminates the dough and apples.\nCoax the dough back into a ball, making sure the apples are evenly distributed throughout. Put back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 1 hour at room temperature again.\nRe-flour your work surface and dump the dough back out. Apples will spill out but that\u2019s okay! Liberally flour the top of the dough and then roll it out with a rolling pin to a 1-inch thickness.\nUsing a biscuit cutter, cut rounds out of the dough.\nPlace the cutout fritters onto a well floured baking sheet. Pull out the scraps and re-roll to make another round of dough.\nHeat 1 \u00bd quarts vegetable oil to 375\u00b0F. Pat each donut a little and stretch them before dropping into oil.\nCook for 90 seconds, then flip each donut. Cook for 90 seconds more, until golden brown and crisp. Remove and let dry on a wire rimmed baking sheet.\nDo this in batches until all of your fritters are cooked.\nTime to make the glaze! Combine a lot of powdered sugar (about 2 \u00bd cups) and a little bit of milk (about \u00bc cup) and whisk until smooth.\nDunk each fritter into the glaze and let rest back on the rack. Once the first coat has hardened, go in and dunk each fritter again for a double glaze.\nIf you want to make a thicker glaze, double the amount of powdered sugar and use the same amount of milk for an extra thick honey bun-esque glaze.\nServe and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "This method uses a great illustration of how espresso is made with heat and pressure. In addition, it is a great example of how important grind size is and why you cannot use a blade grinder instead of a conical bur.\nThe grinds need to be consistent and a very specific size. If the grind is too coarse, all the extra space between the grinds lets the water pass through too quickly, which will leave you with a semi-strong cup of coffee instead of espresso.\nGrind the coffee a little finer, but not too fine. If there is too little space between the grinds makes it almost impossible to press the coffee through and you\u2019ll most likely break your machine before pulling a single decent shot. It will have the crema you are looking for, but not quite enough coffee.\nThis will be a matter of trial and error until you find the sweet spot. For Babish\u2019s favorite method, take 16g of coffee that is ground between levels one and 1 and 2 on your grinder and tamped with about 20lbs of force.\nFill up the cylinder with 60mL of 200 degree Fahrenheit water and extract with about 35lbs of force.\nFor knowing how much pressure you are putting on the machine, you can use a bathroom scale. Press down on it without putting your entire body weight on it and the extraction should take about 35 seconds.\nA good espresso shot will separate into three parts with a thick creamy crema on top, a  mysterious dark orange body below that that slowly disappears into the crema, and finally, the deep chocolate-y brown coffee underneath it all.",

Whisk to combine and let stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes and then add to your shaggy ball of dough in your stand mixer.\nOnce water is fully absorbed add 2 Tbsp of kosher salt, and then knead on a medium speed for about 5 minutes.\nGenerously oil a bowl, add your dough mixture, cover, and let sit for about 2 hours.\nUsing a rubber spatula, fold the dough stuck to the edges onto itself.\nIn an 18x13 rimmed baking sheet, add about \u00bd a cup of olive oil and spread out until pan is fully coated.\nPlace the bread mixture onto the baking sheet and using the olive oil, fold the mixture onto itself a few times and then start to spread the dough across the surface of the pan. If the dough keeps springing back, place some olive oil on the bread and cover it with plastic wrap for 15 minutes. You may have to do it a few times, but it\u2019ll eventually spread to the whole pan.\nOnce the pan is filled out, hit it with some more oil, and then cover and let it ferment overnight in the fridge so for about 12 hours. If any bubbles form, just poke them with a knife, and using oiled fingers, pull the bread just off the edges.\nCoat bread in olive oil and let sit covered at room temperature for about an hour. Make dimples in the dough with your fingers.\nPreheat oven at 450\u00b0F for 1 hour. Coat the dough one last time with olive oil and kosher salt and bake for about 30 minutes.\nRemove and place on a baking rack for about an hour and half to cool. Serve and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Combine first 11 ingredients in a medium bowl, whisk to combine.  Pat ribs dry, remove membrane, and coat liberally with dry rub, making sure to cover every nook and cranny.  Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.\nIn a large saucepan, combine remaining ingredients, whisk to combine, and cook at a bare simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until thick and syrupy.  Can be made and refrigerated ahead of time - reheat before use.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Be sure to remove the membrane on the back of your ribs. Make a small incision and then, using a paper towel for grip, tear off of the ribs.\nSmoker Method:\nPrepare smoker according to manufacturer directions or your favorite time-honored family tradition.  Stabilize heat at 225\u00b0F - arrange ribs as desired, and smoke for 2-3 hours, or until meat is tender but still holding onto the bones.  Repeatedly baste the meat with barbecue sauce and spray with apple juice every 30 minutes.  Remove from grill, allow to rest in aluminum foil for 10 minutes before slicing, saucing, and serving.\nOven Method - Liquid Smoke:\nPrepare dry rub and barbecue sauce as described above, making substitutions as noted in the ingredients list.  Prepare ribs as usual, and preheat oven to 250\u00b0F.  Place the ribs on an aluminum foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, on a wire rack.  Combine whiskey and liquid smoke, and sprinkle evenly over ribs.  Wrap tightly in aluminum foil and bake for 2-2 1/2 hours, until tender but not falling apart.  Uncover, baste with barbecue sauce, and continue to roast for another 1 1/2 hours.  Baste with barbecue sauce every time the sauce looks sticky and loses its sheen, every 20-30 minutes.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking, increase oven temperature to 500F to create a crust on the exterior of the ribs.  Brush with sauce, slice, and serve.\nOven Method - Wok Smoke:\nPrepare ribs as described above (liquid smoke version), but omit liquid smoke.  Before sprinkling with whiskey, place ribs on a wire rack.  Line a deep wok with aluminum foil, and fill with about a cup of wood chips (hickory & oak).  Place over medium-high heat, and cook until just starting to smoke, about 5 minutes.  Place ribs on top, and cover with aluminum foil, crimping the edges tightly so no smoke escapes.  Lower heat to medium, and smoke for 10 minutes, before removing from the heat and resting for an additional 20.  Remove ribs from foil, sprinkle with plain whisky, and continue recipe as described above.",

Add another cup of flour and continue stirring until a shaggy dough forms and the wooden spoon isn\u2019t useful anymore, in which case, you have to use your hands to mix the dough.\nAdd the final \u00bd cup of flour once the mixture becomes homogeneous and knead for 10 minutes straight until a smooth silky ball of dough forms.\nTurn dough out onto a work surface, cut in half, and set aside 1 half and flatten the other so we can fill it with 1 \u00bd sticks (12 Tbsp) of unsalted butter. Roll it around itself and knead it until it becomes an evenly incorporated but also sticky mess. Add the other half of the dough to the sticky mixture and knead for about 10 minutes until it stops sticking the the countertop.\nButter a large bowl and place dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and store in a warm place for 2 hours or until it has doubled in size.\nAfter the dough has risen, gently deflate it by pulling the edges of the dough in towards the center around the circumference of the dough. Cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4-6 hours or overnight.\nDivide the dough into 18 evenly sized balls and place in a loaf pan that is buttered and lined in parchment paper. Make sure the pan is evenly filled and loosely wrap and place in a warm spot for 2-3 hours.\nBrush dough with a final beaten egg, and bake at 375\u00b0 for 30-40 minutes until the internal temperature is 200\u00b0.\nSlice up the bread and place a few slices in the oven, on a baking sheet, for 30-40 minutes.\nRemove from oven and places slices in the custard mixture (recipe below). Make sure they are evenly coated and start cooking them in a skillet that is hot and lined with 1 Tbsp each butter and canola oil.\nPlace maple syrup and rum whipped cream on top and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Butterfly chicken breasts and pound out between two sheets of plastic wrap until 1/2-inch thick.  Butterfly thick parts of chicken thighs until they are uniform thickness.  In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, hot sauce, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt.  Whisk to combine, and add chicken pieces, tossing to evenly coat.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, and baking soda.  Whip egg whites to stiff peaks and set aside.  Combine egg yolks, buttermilk, and cooled butter, and fold into dry ingredients.  Mix until a mostly smooth batter forms, adding more buttermilk as necessary.  Gently fold in egg whites until just barely combined.  Spray down waffle iron with nonstick spray, and cook waffles according to manufacturer instructions.\nHeat vegetable and peanut oil to 375\u00b0F.  In two separate pie pans, place eggs and flour with baking soda and powder.  Remove chicken pieces from buttermilk brine, shaking off excess liquid, and first coating completely in flour.  Once chicken is evenly coated in flour, toss in eggs until likewise evenly coated.  Dredge once more in flour, and immediately fry in oil for 6-10 minutes, until breasts register 160\u00b0F and thighs register 175\u00b0F.  Drain on a wire rack.\nIn a large saucepan, saut\u00e9 pork sausage (removed from casings if necessary), breaking into small chunks, and cooking until a deep brown fond has formed on the bottom of the pot.  Add flour and cook for 2 additional minutes.  Add milk slowly while stirring, and bring to a gentle simmer until thickened - add more milk as necessary until desired consistency is reached.  Season liberally with freshly ground pepper.\nGrease a deep lasagna pan.  Assemble lasagna as desired \u2014 it\u2019s recommended to start with a layer of chicken thighs, topped with sausage gravy and cheese, then a layer of waffles. Next up, the chicken breasts, more cheese, gravy, scrambled eggs, another layer of waffles, then finishing with even more cheese.  Bake at 375\u00b0F for 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is melted.  Serve with warm maple syrup only to those with excellent health insurance.",

Put onto a paper towel lined baking sheet until they cool to room temperature. Place in the freezer for at least 4 hours.\nTake fries out of the freezer and throw into 400 degree Fahrenheit oil until they are crisp and golden brown. Cooking time will vary, so keep an eye on them. Drain on a wire rack and then dump into a bowl to season with Kosher salt. Toss thoroughly to ensure all fries are salted.",

Cut the rectangle into 2-inch squares, wrap diagonally around a small wooden dowel, and press against a gnocchi stripper to form garganelli.

Beat together and set aside half for later use. In the same large bowl where half mixture remains, add \u00bc tsp of baking soda and 3 Tbsp cornstarch, and whisk until smooth. Cut chicken into 1 inch pieces and add to mixture. Mix together by hand, making sure every piece is coated. Cover and set aside for about 20 minutes.\nIn your shallow breading dish, combine 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup cornstarch, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt. Pour in 3 Tbsp reserved marinade and incorporate using your fingers until it\u2019s clumpy. Set aside.\nMake the sauce: In a small bowl goes 4 Tbsp dark soy sauce, 4 Tbsp chinese cooking wine, 3 Tbsp rice wine vinegar, 4 Tbsp chicken stock, \u00bc cup sugar, 1 tsp roasted sesame seed oil, and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Whisk until completely smooth.\nFrom 6 scallions, thinly slice all whites and 2 inches of the green. Next grate 4 cloves garlic and 2 inches of ginger. In a saute pan over medium high heat, simmer 2 Tbsp vegetable oil and add most of scallions, grated garlic, and grated ginger. Saute for one minute. Add a dozen arbol chiles (optional) and saute for another minute. Pour in sauce and saute for one more minute until sauce has thickened.\nHeat a quart of vegetable oil to 375\u00b0F. Coat chicken in the breading flour mixture while it\u2019s heating. Then add to frying oil one piece at a time and make sure not to crowd, cooking each batch for about 4 minutes. Place batches on wire rack that\u2019s set on a rimmed sheet pan, and place in oven on low heat. Repeat until all chicken is fried.\nAdd chicken to sauce mixture and coat over low heat. Serve with white rice and garnish with leftover sliced scallions. Enjoy!",

Boil for 10 minutes.\nSafely remove and see if the caps have popped down yet, indicating that a vacuum has been created; however it might take a few minutes after removing from water. Let jars cool overnight.\nMake the crepe batter: In a blender, add 2 eggs, \u00be cup whole milk, \u00bd cup water, 1 cup all-purpose flour, and 3 Tbsp melted butter. Pulse that together about 10 times, making sure it\u2019s smooth and homogeneous. Let chill in fridge for at least 45 minutes up to overnight so there are no bubbles.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Cover an oven pan with foil and place a rack on top to cook the meat. Then place various meats including thick cut bacon, breakfast sausages, and some thin slices of spam on top. Cook in oven for 20-25 minutes until brown and crisp.\nBring out a crepe maker pan and lubricate with unsalted butter. Begin pouring a thin layer of crepe mix on top and cook both sides. Repeat until desired number of crepes.\nFill the crepes with a couple pieces of each of the meats and wrap like a burrito.\nIn a small bowl beat 1 egg and a \u00bd cup of milk. In another small bowl fill halfway with plain breadcrumbs. Coat each burrito crepe in the egg milk mixture, then cover generously with breadcrumbs.\nIn a saucepan, heat a generous amount of ghee (clarified butter) to 375\u00b0F before dropping in the coated crepe burritos. Deep fry.\nEnjoy the deeply unhealthy and culturally confused crepe things!",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by making a mound of flour on your countertop with a well in the middle of that you can crack two or three eggs in.\nFollowed by a little drizzle of olive oil (optional), and a pinch of salt.\nGrab a fork and beat/whisk the eggs picking up a little flour with every stroke of the fork.\nOnce it becomes too sticky grab a bench scraper and start folding everything towards the center.\nOnce a shaggy dough starts to form begin to knead the dough by hand for a solid ten minutes. Knead until sore, or when the dough has the consistency of play dough.\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for at least thirty minutes. This lets the gluten relax a little bit before rolling it out.\nAfter thirty minutes, unwrap the dough and start flouring everything - your hands, the dough, the rolling pin, the countertop, and anything else you think needs flouring around you.\nOnce finished flouring, cut the dough down the center into two halves.\nNow it\u2019s time to start gently rolling/laminating it out. Roll like you would be using a pasta machine by rolling it out followed by folding into thirds, turn it 90 degrees and then rolling out again.  Do this 3 times total before going for the big time roll. Roll until you can almost see your hand through it.\nOnce you have the dough rolled out to size and thickness it is time to cut. Start by cutting off the edges to give you an even rectangle. From here you can make lasagna noodles, or filled pasta like tortellini or ravioli.\nFor simple pasta, loosely fold the dough cutting it into nice wide fettuccine pieces. Once finished cutting, unfold all of the pieces to make sure none of them are stuck together.\nOnce all of the noodles are unwound, lift up the noodles and toss them with a little bit of flour to make sure they don\u2019t stick together. Make sure each individual strand is coated with floured.\nHang to dry or placed under plastic wrap until ready to use.\nEnjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Combine the four elements of hand-pulled noodles: 500g of bread flour, 306g of water, 5g of salt, and 4g of a mix of potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate (Note: there are countless ratios that can vary based on a number of factors such as altitude. This is the one that worked best for the video). Mix ingredients until just combined in a stand mixer. Knead for 40 minutes, ideally until dough resembles chewed gum but no need to keep going past 40 minutes if it hasn\u2019t quite reached that consistency. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15-20 minutes.\nGently tug the dough until it\u2019s elongated, fold it over on top of itself, and repeat. This process can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours until the dough resembles chewing gum texture. Pounding the dough against the table as you stretch also helps. Keep the dough hydrated by patting it down and brushing with water every 4-6 tugs. It should be between a very hydrated bread dough and pasta dough. Alternatively, laminate and flatten the dough until it becomes supple enough to pass through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter.\nCut the dough in half to make it easier to work with, keeping the other half covered with plastic. Stretch and give the dough a few slaps on the tabletop to prevent tearing. Give it an even roll, then evenly dust with flour to prevent sticking. It should look like a rope. Fold, stretch, and repeat until noodles form. Alternatively, stretch out each noodle one at a time, resulting in flatter and less uniform noodles. I recommend just putting the dough through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter if you are ever going to try to make these noodles at home.",

Mix until everything is combined.\nPut pork belly into the Ziploc bag and add the curing solution. Squeeze as much air out of the bag as possible before sealing. Place the bag in a high walled container (like a casserole dish) to prevent cross contamination. Put the dish in the fridge for 3-5 days, flipping once per day.\nTo use a stovetop smoker, start by adding 2 Tbsp applewood and 2 Tbsp cherrywood to the bottom of the smoker. Top that with the drip plate, followed by the roasting rack. Lastly place the pork belly on top of the roasting rack. Cover the entire stovetop smoker with aluminum foil.\nAdd the stovetop smoker to a burner over medium heat. Insert a temperature probe into the pork belly so that you can monitor the internal temperature. Once it has been smoking for 30-45 minutes, move the entire pan to the oven.\nFinish the pork belly in a 225\u00b0F oven for another hour, or until it reaches 150\u00b0F internally. Place the meat in a Ziploc bag and chill for about 4 hours.\nWhen completely chilled, remove the bacon from the bag and slice strips to your desired thickness.",

Let it rest for 30 minutes.\nOnce it\u2019s rested for 30 minutes, remove from bowl and lightly dust it with flour. Roll your dough out and then fold into thirds, and then into thirds again. Roll out just a little bit and then wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 more minutes.\nOn a stand mixer attach your pasta attachment. Remove dough from plastic wrap and dust with bread flour. Give it one pass on your pasta rollers widest setting. Fold into thirds, rotate 90\u00b0 and pass it through again on your pasta press at about a 2 or 3. If it seems to long, give it a chop in half.\nDust with bread flour again, before passing though your noodle cutter attachment. Add some more bread flour and twist into little nests on a rimmed baking sheet that\u2019s also been dusted with bread flour.\nPlace noodles in boiling water and cook no longer than 3 minutes checking for doneness at 90 seconds.",

Every 4 cubes of beef, run a cube of fat through so that the mixture is marbled.\nAdd the cure/spice mixture to the ground beef and mix it together quickly to prevent heating up the beef.\nPut half of your beef mixture and half of your ice into a food processor. Pulse to combine until it is a paste like consistency. The ice and beef should emulsify together. Repeat with the second half of beef and ice. This beef mixture is now \u2018farce.\u2019 Before leaving it to cure, pan fry a little bit of the farce in oil so that you can make sure the salt and seasoning is good. If it is, move on to curing.\nTo cure the farce, put the meat in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly up against the surface of the meat. Keep it in the fridge for 24 hours.\nThread the natural sheep hotdog casing onto the sausage stuffer and stuff with the cold farce and twist into hotdogs. Watch the episode to see how I do this!\nLet the hot dogs sit uncovered in the fridge for a couple hours.\nUsing a stove-top smoker (or your preferred smoking method), smoke the hotdogs with mesquite and hickory wood chips over medium-high heat. Once you see whisps of smoke coming out, lower the heat to medium low and keep the smoker at about  170\u00b0F for 45 minutes. Snip them apart into individual hot dogs.",

Every 4 cubes of beef, run a cube of fat through so that the mixture is marbled.\nAdd the cure/spice mixture to the ground beef and mix it together quickly to prevent heating up the beef.\nPut half of your beef mixture and half of your ice into a food processor. Pulse to combine until it is a paste like consistency. The ice and beef should emulsify together. Repeat with the second half of beef and ice. This beef mixture is now \u2018farce.\u2019 Before leaving it to cure, pan fry a little bit of the farce in oil so that you can make sure the salt and seasoning is good. If it is, move on to curing.\nTo cure the farce, put the meat in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly up against the surface of the meat. Keep it in the fridge for 24 hours.\nThread the natural sheep hotdog casing onto the sausage stuffer and stuff with the cold farce and twist into hotdogs. Watch the episode to see how I do this!\nLet the hot dogs sit uncovered in the fridge for a couple hours.\nUsing a stove-top smoker (or your preferred smoking method), smoke the hotdogs with mesquite and hickory wood chips over medium-high heat. Once you see whisps of smoke coming out, lower the heat to medium low and keep the smoker at about  170\u00b0F for 45 minutes. Snip them apart into individual hot dogs.",

    "raw_ingredient_list": "15 ounces tipo 00 flour\n2 whole eggs plus 6 egg yolks\n4 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n2 tsp kosher salt\n2 Tbsp butter\n1 pound genoa salami, sliced into 1/2\u201d rounds\n1/2 pound grated aged provolone\n1 pound low-moisture mozzarella, cut into 1-inch cubes\n12 hard-boiled eggs, sliced in half\n1 recipe Italian red sauce (see Prison Sauce)\n24 meatballs (see above)\n1 recipe garganelli (see above), par boiled until very al dente, tossed with enough sauce to prevent sticking\nWhole nutmeg",
    "raw_procedure": "Begin by pouring the flour onto a wood surface or baking mat, forming a large well in the center, and pouring the eggs, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and kosher salt into it.  Beat with a fork until a thick slurry forms, and using a bench scraper or your hands, form a shaggy dough.  Knead for five minutes or until smooth and not tacky.  Wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F.  Coat the interior of a 5-quart enameled dutch oven with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Unwrap dough, dust with flour, and on a well-floured work surface, begin rolling out into one large disc.  Flour as necessary, and roll out until 1/8-inch thick.  Roll around rolling pin, and unroll into the dutch oven, pressing down into the corners, making sure there is still 8-inch or more hanging outside the dutch oven.\nStart filling the Timpano with a layer of cooked pasta (about 1/4 of the recipe) and a small amount of sauce.  Begin forming layers using 1/4 of each of the fillings: eggs, then meatballs, cheeses, and salami.  Repeat until the Timpano is filled to the brim.  Finish with an extra layer of aged provolone to help prevent the ingredients from leaking later on, after the Timpano is flipped.  Fold the excess dough up from the sides and press down on top, sealing shut.  For a softer crust, cover the dutch oven and bake for about 2 hours, until internal temperature registers at least 125\u00b0F, and exterior is golden brown.  For a crispier crust, bake uncovered.\nAllow Timpano to rest for one hour before placing a large cutting board or plate over top of the dutch oven, and inverting the Timpano onto it.  Cut into slices, and serve atop a pool of warm sauce, grating fresh nutmeg over top.",

    "raw_procedure": "Apply gloves and glasses before cutting the peppers on a cutting sheet or board. Remove the stem from each pepper and cut the rest of the pepper into one inch segments. You want to end up with about a pound of peppers total. I used a lot of habanero for heat, but you can try whatever combination of peppers you\u2019d like.\nPut the peppers in a blender along with four cloves of garlic and a cup of white vinegar. Blend on low speed, stopping to push all the peppers down, then blend on high speed for at least one minute until smooth. Pour into a mason jar or safe container and cover with plastic wrap to let sit out at room temperature for three days to ferment. Little bubbles rising at the surface means it is in fact fermenting.\nStrain the sauce through not too fine a mesh strainer. We want some pepper solids to make it through so it thickens the sauce.\nCook sauce in a sauce pan for 10-15 minutes at a bare simmer before tasting for seasoning -- adding salt to taste, a pinch of sugar to help round out the flavors, and a little MSG.\nFill a large high-walled pot or dutch oven a quarter of the way with vegetable oil and bring to 225\u00b0F. Rinse and thoroughly pat down about 20 chicken wings, then cook in vegetable oil for about 20 minutes. Remove the (pale) wings and place on a cooling rack for at least one hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge.\nOnce chicken is cooled, put a small amount of chicken wings in oil that is heated to 400\u00b0F and fry for 10 minutes. Chicken will be sticky for the first few minutes so try to pull them apart. Repeat process until all chicken is fried, placing on cooling rack set in a rim baking sheet and keep in a low oven to keep warm.\nTake wings out of oven, the sooner after frying the better, and toss with heated sauce in a large bowl until wings are covered. Put on plate and serve with carrots, celery, and blue cheese dressing. Enjoy!",

Break up the shell into pieces and place in a high-powered blender along with vegetable oil, and blend for 30-60 seconds, or until lobster is finely ground.  Simmer mixture for 15 minutes, and strain through a fine mesh sieve.  Set aside to cool completely.\nIn an immersion blender cup, combine lemon and egg yolks.  Blend briefly to combine, and with immersion blender running, slowly pour lobster oil down the side of the cup, until a thick aioli forms.  Refrigerate until ready to use.\nCook bacon as desired, reserve fat.  Brush Cornish game hen with fat, and fry skin-side-down in a hot cast iron skillet, flipping once golden.  After flipping, place in the oven and cook until meat registers 165\u00b0F, about 10 minutes.\nAssemble the sandwich - halve the loaf, and torch both sides of the interior with a culinary torch (only for accuracy - recommend toasting bread in the oven or throwing under the broiler).  Spread with cream cheese, and shingle sliced pickles on one side of the sandwich, while sprinkling dill on the other side of the sandwich.  On the pickle side of the sandwich, shingle the hard boiled egg slices, followed by the Cornish game hen, followed by cucumber, then sweet yellow onion, roma tomatoes, steak, tears, and bacon.  Coat the other side of the bread with lobster aioli, top the sandwich, slice, and serve.",

The thinner the dough, the more layers for the lachha.\nBrush the dough with ghee, dust it with a little bit of flour, and fold the dough in a form that is similar to an accordion.\nSlap the folded dough on the counter to stretch it out, then roll each section up in pinwheel form. Make sure to tuck the ends of the dough under the surface.

Let stand, tossing occasionally, until bread is completely moist (about 10 minutes). Squeeze bread between your fingers or mash with a spoon to make sure there are no dry spots; if there are dry spots that refuse to moisten, add more buttermilk 1 tablespoon at a time until bread is moist throughout.\nAdd onion, garlic, parmesan, parsley, salt, pepper, pancetta, egg yolks, oregano, and demi-glace to bread/buttermilk mixture.\nSet mixer bowl in stand mixer and attach paddle. Starting at low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high speed, beat bread mixture until thoroughly blended, stopping to scrape down sides as necessary. Add 1/3 each of the beef, pork, and veal and beat at medium-high speed until thoroughly blended with bread mixture.\nRemove bowl from stand mixer and add remaining beef, pork, and veal. Gently mix meatball mixture by hand, tearing apart ground meat with your fingers, just until ground meats are thoroughly distributed throughout; avoid mixing any more than is necessary for even distribution.\nHeat 3 tablespoons leaf lard in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, and sear meatballs on all sides before adding to sauce during its final hour of cooking.",

    "raw_procedure": "Melt white chocolate in a double boiler.  Fold in corn syrup, mix until homogenous and a thick paste forms.  Wrap in plastic wrap and allow to set in a cool room for 24 hours.  Remove from plastic wrap, add a few drops of ube extract or food coloring, and fold into the chocolate until the desired color is achieved.  If the chocolate starts to become oily, add a bit of sifted corn starch.  Shape into horns and set aside, refrigerating if the chocolate needs to firm up.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F.  Sift together flour, baking powder, 3/4 cup sugar, and salt.  Whisk to combine.  In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks, vegetable oil, milk, ube, ube extract, and food coloring, until a deep purple color is achieved, and whisk together with dry ingredients. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat egg whites until light and frothy.  Add 3/4 cup sugar, and beat with the whisk attachment until glossy stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the egg whites into the cake batter, taking care not to deflate them.\nLightly oil 4-inch mini springform pans (or a cupcake pan or large casserole), and fill 3/4 full with cake batter.  Bake for 35-40 minutes, until a tester comes out clean, and the exterior of the cake is golden brown.  Remove from the oven, allow to cool 10 minutes, and remove from springforms/cake pans.  Allow to cool completely on a wire rack.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together cream cheese and butter.  Add sifted powdered sugar and mix slowly, gradually increasing mixer speed as sugar is incorporated, until a thick frosting forms.  Divide in half, and mix first half of frosting with ube extract until light purple.  Beat together second half with durian or fruit of choice, coloring with brown food color as necessary until the correct color is achieved.\nAssemble the cakes: slice the cakes in half latitudinally, and spread on a generous layer of light purple frosting.  Top with top half of cake, pipe on a cone of durian frosting, and press white chocolate horns into each side of the frosting.",

Process to combine.\nButter 2 ramekins and set aside.\nCook one box of pasta or make your own and add pasta to the feta sauce. Toss to combine and twirl up some pasta into the buttered ramekins.\nUsing a fork and spoon, put the pasta to the sides, creating a hole in the middle. Then bake at 400\u00b0 for 10 minutes.\nRemove ramekins from the oven and run a small paring knife around the outside of the ramekin to loosen it. Crack an egg in each of the wells you created and place back in the oven to bake for 10-15 minutes until the whites are set but yolks are runny.\nInvert pasta in ramekin onto an interim plate while we start plating.\nSpoon some of the non-feta sauce into a pool on the bottom of the plate and top with saut\u00e9ed spinach.\nPlace pasta with egg on top and add some of the garbanzo beans as a delicious garnish.",

    "raw_procedure": "Combine 1 \u00bd cups each of the best milk and heavy cream that can be found in a large saucepan. Add 6 tablespoons of sugar and 1/3 cup corn syrup. Split Tahitian vanilla beans down the side with a paring knife and use the back of the knife (or a small spoon) to scrape out the beans. Deposit both the beans and the casing into the milk and cream mixture. Add a pinch of kosher salt. Put the saucepan on medium-low heat until it reaches 175\u00b0F.\nSeparate the yolks from 6 cage-free eggs and place them into a medium bowl with a moist paper towel underneath the bowl. Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar and whisk until combined. Remove cream mixture from the saucepan on the stove. Whisking constantly, slowly ladle in one full ladle of the hot mixture into the eggs to temper them. Then, dump egg mixture into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly until thickened and at 185\u00b0F. Be sure not to rush over too high of a flame or there will be little dots in the custard and scrambling on the bottom of the pan. Once it reaches temperature, pour immediately into a heatproof bowl and let the bowl sit for 15-20 minutes until it stops steaming. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the custard. Place into the fridge for 4-24 hours.\nOnce the custard is chilled, dig out pieces of the vanilla pod, and churn custard using method of choice. The custard should be 21\u00b0F, which can take 15-30 minutes depending on the device. Start taking its temperature when the mixture starts to resemble soft serve. Dump into a pre-frozen metal container, such as a loaf pan, and spread out evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the freezer for at least 4 hours.\nAdd 12 ounces of high-quality high butterfat milk and 3 ounces of Devonshire clotted cream to a blender. Dig out Madagascar vanilla beans from pods and add to blender. Scoop out approximately 18 ounces of the homemade Tahitian vanilla ice cream and top with edible gold leaf before dumping into the blender. Very gently pour in the bare minimum amount of Louis XIII (or other high-quality spirit). Blend for about 30 seconds until completely smooth and studded with bits of gold. Pour into a milkshake glass. Top with whipped cream, edible gold, a maraschino cherry, and donkey caramel sauce.",

Generously flour a work surface and place one of the doughs on top. Pressing gently using your fingertips, push the dough out to form a disc, leaving the edge slightly thicker.  Once the dough is about 8 inches wide, pick it up and drape it over your knuckles, letting gravity stretch out the dough.

Ladle about \u00bd cup of sauce onto the dough and spread around until evenly coated. Scatter half of the mozzarella over the top, making sure not to get any sauce or cheese on the edge of the dough crust. Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone and bake until the crust is well browned and the cheese is bubbly and browned in spots, about 12 minutes.

Slice into thin ribbons and then slice the ribbons crosswise into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.\nFor the batter, combine 1 cup cake flour with 1 \u00bd tsp of baking powder. Grate 1 Japanese mountain yam (or combine \u00bd a cup of milk with 1 tsp of baking powder) into the dry ingredients and then add 1 cup dashi broth. Whisk to combine and place in the fridge for 30 minutes.\nLightly beat 4 large eggs and add into the mixture once you remove if from the fridge. Then add \u00bc cup pickled red ginger, about \u00be of your chopped scallions, \u00bd a cup of tenkasu, and about \u00be of your chopped cabbage. Fold in and mix together until everything is combined. Then add your remaining cabbage and mix that in as well.\nIn a large non-stick skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil over a medium heat. Add \u00bd of your mixture to the pan, and using 2 rubber spatulas, coax it into the proper shape, about 1 inch thick and about 8 inches around. Top with pork belly (or bacon) and cover for 5 minutes.\nAfter 5 minutes remove top and using either one big spatula or two small ones, flip and let cook, covered, for another 5 minutes.\nRemove from heat and transfer to a plate. Brush the top with a generous layer of Okonomiyaki sauce, and then stripe it with the Japanese mayonnaise, then using a wooden skewer, create a zig-zag pattern.\nOptionally top with dried bonito flakes, aonori, and scallions, serve and enjoy!",

Pour this mixture into the pan. Stir around with a fork until some curds form. Keep doing this until you can see the bottom of the pan when you move the fork. At this point let the eggs cook for about 2 minutes and let a sort of omelette crust form. Add your mushroom and pepper fillings and fold the omelette shut.\nUsing two spatulas, move to a large plate. Cover with 4 cups of chili, 2 cups of american cheese and add two biscuits.

Set aside.\nTake 4 chicken thighs and season with salt and pepper on the skin side.\nAdd a little oil to a stainless steel or cast iron skillet and put over high heat. Once it\u2019s ripping hot, add chicken thighs, skin side down. Season meat side with salt and pepper. Flip when they\u2019re brown and pull away cleanly from the bottom of the pan. Cook for a few minutes but don\u2019t cook them through, you just want some color on there.\nRemove chicken and all but 1 tbsp of chicken fat in the pan. Add sweet potatoes and Granny Smith apples. Saut\u00e9 over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nDeglaze with a few glugs of bourbon, and after the alcohol has burned off add enough chicken stock to see it pool under the potatoes and apples. Add minced sage, and mix to combine.\nAdd the chicken back to the pan making sure it\u2019s skin side up and place the whole thing in the oven preheated to 375\u00b0F and cook until thickest part of the chicken thigh reaches 175\u00b0F.\nRoughly chop some pecans and toast them.\nAdd some lemon juice to the pan with the chicken, potatoes, and apples.\nTop the whole thing with toasted pecans and chives.\nServe and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "First, make a mirepoix. To make a mirepoix, take 2 medium carrots, 1 medium onion, and 2 stalks of celery, and chop them into manageable bite-sized pieces.\nHeavily season your flour with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Then use it to coat 6 veal shanks. Pat it down into the meat and flip to repeat on the other sides of each shank. To ensure the shanks\u2019 structural integrity, tie each shank with a length of butcher\u2019s twine.\nInto a large dutch oven, heat some grapeseed oil over medium-high heat until shimmering before dropping in the veal shanks. Give each shank 3 to 5 minutes per side until you end up with a nice brown color on both sides. It is best to perform this step in two batches so that the shanks do not become overcrowded. After searing, you will end up with leftover browned food residue (fond) that will serve as the basis of great flavor when you are braising.\nPour your mirepoix into the dutch oven and saut\u00e9 for about 5 minutes until it begins to soften and turn brown. Then, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and 6 whole crushed cloves of garlic. Once you have let that saut\u00e9 for an additional minute or until fragrant, deglaze the pot using about 2 \u00bd cups of dry white wine. For a darker and more robust stew, use a dry red wine instead.\nScrape off all of the residue from the bottom of the pot. Add a couple sprigs each of fresh rosemary and thyme, 2 cups of high quality or homemade beef stock, and 2 dried bay leaves.\nPour the entirety of one 28-oz can of San Marzano tomatoes into a mixing bowl and crush them by hand. Then, add the crushed tomatoes to the braising liquid on medium-high heat, attempting to bring it up to a simmer as you begin to add your veal shanks into the pot side-by-side. Add a few extra marrow bones to the pot as well.\nBring the mixture up to a rolling simmer and partially cover the pot. Place the pot into a 325\u00b0F oven for 2 to 3 hours.\nOnce finished, take it out of the oven and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes. The veal shanks should be tender enough to the point where you can easily pierce them with a paring knife. Get the marrow bones out of the pot and scoop out their soft rich interiors. Finely chop the interiors until it is almost a paste and add it to your risotto.\nRemove the veal shanks from the pot and set them aside. Strain the leftover sauce into a medium saucepan, making sure to stir up and press down on the solids to extract every drop of the liquid. You should end up with a thin and oily sauce. Allow it to cool for a few minutes, skim all of the fat off of the top, and reduce for about 30 minutes until it is thick and syrupy.\nFor assembling, lay down a bed of risotto on a plate, place your veal shank over top and remove the string, and ladle the braising liquid along with some of the aromatic vegetables over top before garnishing with gremolata.",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by making your pizza dough. Combine flour, kosher salt, and active dry yeast in a big bowl.\nAdd room temperature water and mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms and no dry clumps remain.\nGenerously oil a medium bowl with olive oil. Put the ball of dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 18-24 hours.\nOnce rested, turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. Cut the dough in half, as this will make 2 crusts for the cast iron skillet.\nOil the skillet with olive oil. Place the dough in the plate and gently coax the it to the edges using your fingers.\nCover the pan with plastic wrap and let rest for at least one hour or until doubled in size. Now is also the time to preheat your oven - turn it on to its max heat setting and put a pizza stone in the oven as well.\nWhile your dough rises, make tomato sauce. Combine tomatoes, garlic cloves, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a food processor or large cup for an immersion blender. Pulse a few times until smooth. Optionally, add a dash of olive oil for extra flavor.\nPrepare your other toppings - I love to use natural casing pepperoni, thinly sliced, as well as low moisture (full fat) mozzarella and fresh basil.\nNow that the dough is ready, top it with sauce edge to edge, then add the shredded mozzarella. Top with pepperoni and basil.\nBake for about 11-12 minutes.\nTop with freshly grated parmesan and let rest for at least 5 minutes so you don\u2019t burn your mouth. Serve and enjoy!",

Put fermentation weights on top of the cabbage to keep everything under the brine.\nTo make the pickling brine, combine 2 \u00bd Tbsp of kosher salt and 4 cups of water. Stir until everything is dissolved and then pour on top of potatoes.\nCover the mason jars with some airlock lids, or use a glass bowl and some plastic wrap. Let sit for three straight days.\nAfter 3 days, drain the pickled potatoes. Deep fry the potatoes in oil for about 8 minutes. Set aside and drain on paper towels.\nUsing a mortar and pestle, crush 2 cloves of garlic, making it into a paste. Add two egg yolks and mix them into the garlic paste until they are well-combined. While mixing rapidly, slowly drizzle in some neutral flavored oil until an emulsion forms.\nOnce your aioli has outgrown the mortar, transport the mixture into a larger bowl. Whisk the mixture while slowly adding olive oil, alternating between different oils depending on preference. Slowly add oil until a thick emulsion forms. Maybe about \u00bd cup of combined oils for every egg yolk. Season to taste with kosher salt.\nPut the deep fried potatoes in a bowl and season them with kosher salt and smoked paprika, to taste.\nPour your potatoes onto a serving plate and top them with the aioli and some sliced scallions.",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by making an Italian Red Sauce from Basics With Babish: Sauces. Once you get all the ingredients together and the sauce is simmering, place in the oven with a cocked lid for 4 hours at 325\u00b0F.\nIn a bowl mix 3 slices of torn white bread, 2 cloves of fresh garlic, 1 small minced onion, a generous grating of parmesan, a generous grating of nutmeg, \u00bc cup each of chopped basil and chopped parsley, and a pinch of dried oregano.\nMix chicken stock with 1 packet of gelatin mix and add that to the mixture as well.\nNext add 1 lb each of beef, pork, and veal, and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until everything is fully combined.\nOnce combined, shape into balls, and place on a well oiled rack on a rimmed baking sheet and bake at 400\u00b0F for 20-30 minutes or until browned.\nSlice eggplant and place on a wire baking sheet. Season with salt on both sides and let sit for 2 hours.\nRemove meatballs from the oven and place in your red sauce. Place sauce on stove and let simmer with meatballs on a low heat for about 45 minutes.\nFor the eggplant, chicken, and veal we\u2019re going to do a simple flour, egg, bread crumb mixture. First place in the flour, then into the egg, and then into the panko bread crumbs. For the veal, I used italian seasoning bread crumbs, but you can use either.\nHeat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 350\u00b0F. First add in your eggplant. Make sure you don\u2019t over crowd and that it\u2019s one even layer of frying. Once brown, give them a flip, cook for another minute, let the excess oil drip off and then place on a wire rack to dry. Do the same with the chicken and veal.\nCombine butter, garlic, and herbs to make a compound butter and spread that on the inside of a hoagie roll that has been cut in half lengthwise. Place bread under broiler until just brown. Remove from the oven and top one half with either the veal, chicken, meatballs, or eggplant. Place some pieces of mozzarella on top of that and sprinkle it with parmesan and place back under the broiler until cheese is melted. Remove from the broiler and put some red sauce on top of the cheese. Cover with the other half of bread. Cut in half and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by mixing 2 \u00bd ounces each of Semolina flour and all purpose flour with a little kosher salt and 2.3 ounces of eggs. Whisk with a fork until roughly combined. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until tacky (not sticky). Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge for 30 minutes.\nFor the semolina pasta dough, combine 5 ounces of flour with 2 ounces of water. Whisk until roughly combined. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead until tacky. Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge for 30 minutes.\nRemove pasta from fridge. Cut in half, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out your dough and then run it through on the widest setting on your pasta roller. Laminate the dough by folding into thirds and rolling out again. Do this 3 times. One notch at a time, roll your dough thinner and thinner until you get to about number 3, then put through the pasta cutter.\nPlace pasta on a flour-dusted baking sheet in a little nest. Cover in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Do this process for both pasta doughs.\nNext, pit and chop 4 ounces of olives, finely chop 2 Tbsp of capers, and 1 can of anchovies. Make sure you also have about \u00bd cup of minced parsley. Also lightly chop 5-7 cloves of garlic.\nSaut\u00e9 the garlic in 3-4 Tbsp of olive oil for about 1 minute on medium-high heat. Add 1 can of whole tomatoes, and while bringing them to a simmer, crush the tomatoes up with a spoon.\nOnce sauce is brought to a simmer, add 2 Tbsp of anchovies, \u00bd cup of black olives, and 2 Tbsp chopped capers.\nStir and then let simmer for 8-9 minutes. When your sauce gets to a point when you can run your spoon across the bottom and see the bottom of the pot, that\u2019s when you kill the heat, and add the chopped parsley.\nLet the sauce cool slightly while you cook your pasta. Bring some water to a boil and cook your pasta for about 1 minute. Strain, add the noodles back to their pot, and add 2 Tbsp of butter and some black pepper for seasoning.\nPlace pasta in a bowl and add your on top sauce. Garnish with extra parsley.\nAn alternative way of doing this (Babish\u2019s method) is to add some sauce to a saut\u00e9 pan on a medium heat. Cook your pasta for about 30 seconds and then add it to separated sauce to finish cooking in the sauce. Add 1 Tbsp of butter and give the whole thing a good stir. Place in a bowl, add some extra sauce and maybe some parmesan cheese, serve and enjoy!",

If you're pressed for time, dry out the skin with a hair dryer.\nRoast the duck at 350\u00b0F for 1 to 1 \u00bd hours.\nWhile the duck roasts, make a Mandarin-style pancake by combining 2/3 of a cup of boiling water with 10 ounces of all-purpose flour until a shaggy dough forms.\nTurn the dough out on a floured work surface and knead until smooth and supple.\nRoll into a 2-inch log and divide into 24 pieces.\nCover the pieces in plastic wrap until ready to use them.\nWhen ready to use, divide one piece at a time in half and roll both halves into 3-inch round pieces.\nBrush one side with a light layer of sesame seed oil.\nSandwich the oiled sides together and role the whole thing into a 7 to 9 inch pancake.\nToast the pancake in a dry pan until light brown spots begin to form.\nCarve the duck breast meat in 1/2 inch slices.\nFill a pancake with finely sliced cucumber and scallions, add the duck meat and top with a bit of the hoisin sauce.\nEnjoy!",

It took about 16 tablespoons for me.\nTurn the dough out onto a flat work surface and gently knead it into one cohesive mass. Don\u2019t worry if the dough looks a little dry and crumbly because it will continue to hydrate once it is placed in the fridge. Take a knife and divide the dough into two slices.\nWrap the dough in plastic and pat it out into a thick round disc so that the dough is easier to roll out later. Place the dough into the fridge and let sit for at least 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes has passed, the dough should be nice and firm and should look like it has hydrated nicely. In addition, it should be visibly dappled with little bits of butter. Take half of the dough, wrap with plastic, and place it back into the fridge for later.\nOn a flat work surface that is covered with flour, and adding flour as needed, roll the dough out to a diameter that is one to two inches wider than the pie plate you intend to use.\nOnce the dough is rolled out to your desired specifications, use your rolling pin to lift it up over countertop and transfer it over to your pie plate.\nInstead of pressing the pie dough into the corners, lift and drop it into the corners to avoid stretching the pie dough. Make sure that the dough is generously hanging over the sides of the plate. Place it into the fridge and let sit for 30 minutes.\nOnce 30 minutes has passed, line the pie dough with aluminum foil and fill it with the pie weight of your choice, such as rice. Place in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly brown. Remove the foil and \u201cdock\u201d the crust by poking several little holes in the bottom of the crust using a fork. Place back into the oven for another 7 to 9 minutes until a little more golden brown.\nAfter the crust is removed from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before using a fork to poke and deflate any puff ups. Trim off the excess pie dough around the circumference.\nTo make the additional layer of crust, roll out the other half of your dough to the same thinness and cover the filling making sure that it is evenly distributed. Trim off any excess dough and tuck it in gently underneath the par baked crust.\nCut a couple of vents in the top of the dough and brush the entire thing down with a beaten egg white and sprinkle with a few pinches of granulated sugar.\nPlace into a 425\u00b0F oven for 35 to 50 minutes. Let it cool for at least 4 hours.",

    "raw_procedure": "In a medium bowl, combine 1 pound of squab breasts with 2 Tbsp onion, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, soaked cherries, 1 tsp salt, and freshly ground pepper.  Set aside, and repeat with wild boar: onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp salt, and pepper.  With the remaining squab breasts, combine the apple, 2 tsp sage, 1 tsp thyme, salt, and pepper.  Finally, with the rabbit, combine mushrooms, 2 tsp thyme, and 1 tsp rosemary.  Keep all meats separate.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F.  Whisk together flours and salt in a large bowl.  Bring lard and water to a bare simmer and add to the flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.  Once it\u2019s cool enough to handle, knead until it forms a smooth, tacky dough.  Roll out 2/3 of the dough to a 24-inch round, covering the remainder with a warm/damp towel, and drape over a liberally-greased and floured springform mold.  Gently coax the dough down into the mold and press into the corners, patching as necessary to seal it.  Begin filling the pastry - first with the cherry squab, a layer of bacon strips, then the wild boar, another layer of bacon, the apple squab, another layer of bacon, and the rabbit.  Make sure the meat is pressed deeply into every corner, and roll out a knob of dough until it\u2019s the size of a lid for the pastry.  Cover and pinch the edges, sealing like a pie.  Cut a steam hole in the center of the lid, and decorate as desired with remaining pastry.\nBake pie for 30 minutes at 400\u00b0F, then lower the temperature to 325\u00b0F, baking for an additional 90 minutes, or until pastry is browned and filling reaches 165\u00b0F internally.  Trim the crust as necessary so the springform can eventually release - allow to cool for at least 2 hours before attempting to remove, ideally refrigerating overnight.  Slice and serve with grain mustard.",

    "raw_procedure": "First we are going to toast and grind our spice mixture. In a saucepan, combine a few chinese chilis, 1 tsp coriander seed, 1 tsp cardamom, 2 tsp cumin seed, 1 tsp mustard seeds, 1 crushed cinnamon stick, and 1 tsp peppercorns. Cook over high heat until fragrant and slightly smoking, and then add to spice grinder, grind, and set aside.\nNext add 2 cups of short grain rice and 4 cups of water to a pan that you\u2019re going to cover tightly and place in a 325\u00b0F for 5 minutes longer than the specified boiling time. Once cooked, spread rice on a baking sheet to cool for an hour.\nPrep all of your accoutrements. Chop your red peppers, carrots, green onions, chopped cashews, and bird\u2019s eye chili.\nSlice pineapple in half. Place a cut skin deep around the pineapple and score at 2 cm wide intervals, and scoop out into a bowl and set aside.\nIn a wok, heat 3 Tbsp of vegetable oil over maximum heat. Add 2 beaten eggs to the wok and cook until just barely set and then add your chopped red pepper, carrot, and bird\u2019s eye chili. Add 1 Tbsp grated ginger, 1 Tbsp grated turmeric, and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Give it a good mix before adding all of the rice.\nNext add a little bit of our spice powder, some kosher salt, 1 Tbsp each of rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, sesame oil, and soy sauce.\nStir and continue to cook over a high heat before adding pineapple. Add some chopped green onions and some chopped cashews.\nMake sure that you slightly undercook the rice because we\u2019re going to steam cook it a little bit more in our hollowed out pineapple.\nSalt both sides of your pineapple.\nFill one half of the pineapple with all of the rice, and form it into a mound. Cover with the other side of the pineapple and place in a 375\u00b0F oven for 30 minutes.\nGenerously butter a bowl.\nTake the pineapple out of the oven and scoop rice into buttered bowl. Place a plate upside down on top of the bowl, and while holding the bowl and plate, flip over so the plate is on the bottom and the bowl is on top. Lay the Pineapple stem at the top for aesthetics. Dig in and enjoy!",

Whisk together and let stand 15 to 20 minutes for mixture to rise and make a loose sponge. Mixture will bubble and foam.\nPour 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and salt into sponge then add 1 3/4 cup flour. Mix at low speed, using a dough hook attachment, until dough is soft, supple, and slightly sticky. If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add up to 1/4 cup more flour, a little at a time.\nKnead dough with machine on low speed until slightly springy and still soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a ball.\nWipe inside of bowl with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil. Turn dough around in bowl to cover with a thin film of oil; cover bowl with foil and let sit until dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours.\nRemove dough from bowl and place onto a floured work surface. Lightly pat into a flat shape about 1 inch thick. Use a knife to cut dough into 8 pieces.\nForm each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath the bottom.\nCover dough balls with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\nSprinkle a small amount of flour on a work surface and top of a dough ball; gently pat dough ball flat with your fingers, forming a flat, round bread about 1/4 inch thick. Let dough round rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough balls.\nBrush a cast-iron skillet with remaining 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Lay pita bread into hot skillet and cook until bread begins to puff up and bottom has brown spots and blisters, about 3 minutes. Flip, cook 2 more minutes, and flip back onto original side to cook for about 30 more seconds. Pita bread will begin to puff up and fill with hot air. Stack cooked breads on a plate when cool enough to handle.",

Chop two of the garlic cloves, and in a small bowl, whisk together with the juice of two limes, cumin, cayenne, one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon pepper, and a tablespoon of olive oil.  Pour marinade over chicken, seal the bag, and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nRinse rice in a large bowl until water runs clear.  Drain, and add to 3 1/2 cups of water in a large saucepan, along with the bay leaf, a teaspoon of salt, and a clove of garlic.  Bring to a simmer and cover, reducing heat to low, and cooking until water is absorbed and rice is tender and fluffy.  If the rice is too \u2018al dente\u2019, add water 1/4 cup at a time until completely cooked.  Fluff with a fork and keep warm until serving.\nWhile rice simmers, combine bacon and 1/4 cup of water in another large saucepan.  Cook until the bacon fat has rendered completely and bacon is crispy.  Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon from the rendered fat, and add minced onion and green pepper.  Saut\u00e9 over medium heat until soft and golden, and add one crushed garlic clove.  Saut\u00e9 until fragrant (about another minute), add bacon back to the pot, and add soaked black beans and their liquid.  Simmer uncovered until beans are breaking and liquid has thickened, about 30 minutes.  Cover and keep warm until serving.\nOn a large cast iron griddle or in a large cast iron pan, heat one tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.  Add onions and sear, cooking until golden and lightly charred - place in a bowl and cover with aluminum foil until serving.  Add the last tablespoon of vegetable oil to the griddle, remove chicken breasts from the bag and shake off excess marinade, and sear on hot griddle.  Flip once golden-brown on one side, and continue to cook until internal temperature reads 165\u00b0F, about 5 minutes on each side.\nArrange chicken, rice, and beans side-by-side on a plate, molding the rice into a wide cylinder with a plastic takeout container.  Top chicken with saut\u00e9d onions, garnish with cilantro, and serve.",

    "raw_procedure": "Remove the skin of the pork belly that will be inside the roll. Click the image above to watch the episode and see how I did it.\nDeeply score the meat inside the belly with cuts roughly two inches apart and about an inch deep. Do it in both directions to make a cross hatch pattern.\nTrim the edges of pork belly to make a perfect rectangle.\nTime to spice things up. Use the spices according to your preference and how big your roast is. I added grated nutmeg, orange zest, sage, rosemary, fennel fronds, toasted pine nuts, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and crushed garlic.\nPress the seasonings into the cuts you slit and make sure it\u2019s all evenly distributed.\nRoll up the roast as tight as you can. Using a sharp knife, make lots of lateral cuts on the outside of the roast - just deep enough that they go through the skin, but not so deep that they go into the fat.\nTie the roast with butcher\u2019s twine every 2-3 inches.\nPlace the roast on a rack set in a wire-rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate overnight uncovered.\nLine your baking sheet with foil, and put the wire rack and roast back inside. Set your oven to 250\u00b0F. Insert a temperature probe into the thickest part of the roast so you can monitor it.\nRoast slow and low for 3-8 hours, depending on the size of your roast. You\u2019re waiting on it to hit an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F.\nCarefully remove from the oven - there will be a lot of liquid fat!\nCrank the oven up to 500\u00b0F. Put the roast back in and keep a close eye on it to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn.\nLet rest for 30 minutes before slicing.",

Place a large cut down the bottom third of the roast opening it up like a book until we reach the other end of the roast at which point you make another cut opening the roast yet again, kinda like a pamphlet.\nCover with plastic wrap and use a meat mallet to pound out the pork until it has leveled out. You don\u2019t want to tenderize it or anything like that, just make it even.\nIn a cold stainless steel pan, place 8 minced cloves of garlic and a few tablespoons of freshly chopped rosemary along with \u2153 cup nice of olive oil and the zest of one lemon.\nBring the pan to a slow simmer on a medium low heat and once it has cooked for about 2-3 minutes, strain into a heat-proof container using a fine mesh sieve. Reserve the oil for later, you\u2019ll use the paste now.\nAdd one pack of pancetta to a food processor and pulse it a few times before adding your garlic and rosemary herb paste mixture. Process until it forms a smooth spreadable paste - so for about 60 seconds.\nSeason both sides of the pork roast with salt and pepper before placing the pork roast fat side down. Spread the herb mixture even over pork loin leaving about a 2-inch gap on one side of the roast.\nRoll roast tightly towards the 2 inch gap and when it\u2019s totally rolled, use butcher\u2019s twine to tightly secure pork. You should tie a knot about every inch. Place on a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and cook at 275\u00b0F for about 2 hours or until it reads 135\u00b0F in the thickest part of the roast.\nAdd vegetable oil to a cast iron skillet, and once skillet is ripping hot, add your pork roast, browning on all sides. Also cut one lemon in half and place in skillet face down. When the lemons are slightly brown, remove from skillet.\nAdd lemon juice to the reserved oil from the garlic and rosemary herb spread. Also add some freshly chopped parsley and whisk together until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.\nRemove butcher\u2019s twine from the roast, and slice into \u00bd inch thick slices. Top with lemon herb vinaigrette. Serve and enjoy.",

    "raw_procedure": "In a stand mixer, add 8 medium eggs (or 6 large eggs), 5 \u00bd ounces of granulated sugar, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. Whisk for about 8 minutes. On a piece of parchment paper, sift 3 \u00bd ounces of all purpose flour and 2 ounces of cocoa powder. Slowly add to whipped eggs and mix with the paddle attachment for about 2 minutes before adding 3 Tbsp of melted butter.\nOil two cake pans and then line the bottoms with parchment paper and oil that as well. Split batter between the two pans. Place in a 350\u00b0F oven for 30 minutes. Set aside and allow to cool completely.\nStrain 1 jar of morello cherries, but save the juice. Stem and cut each cherry in half. Over a medium high heat in a medium saucepan, add your cherries along with \u00bd cup powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, \u00bd cup of the cherry juice, and \u00bc cup Kirsch. Mix to combine and cook until it all becomes a syrup consistency. Place in a bowl and set aside.\nRemove cakes from cake pans. Cut each cake in half, making 4 total layers of cake.\nIn a stand mixer combine 2 pints of heavy cream and 1 cup of powdered sugar. Combine until you have whipped cream. Set aside.\nPlace a little whipped cream down to help the cake not slide and then top \u00bd of the round with some Kirsch followed by whipped cream and cherries. Top with the next cake round along with more whipped cream and cherries. The amount of layers is up to you, I added 3 layers of cake rounds. Once you add your last round, cover the entire cake with whipped cream.\nIf you\u2019re making chocolate shavings, scrape your knife across the top of a chocolate bar of choice to make it into curly shavings. You can also buy chocolate shavings if you\u2019d prefer.\nAdd your chocolate shavings to the entire cake on top of the whipped cream. You may want to use gloves to help with the chocolate melting. Once the cake is completely covered, use a piping bag and whipped cream to make some flower blossoms on top of the cake and top each of those with a cherry.\nSlice it up, serve and enjoy!",

Remove milk from heat, add yeast and let sit for about 5 minutes, or until frothy and bubbly.\nPut milk and yeast mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer and add the brown sugar, all purpose flour, bread flour, salt, and butter. Knead mixture for 10 minutes using the dough hook attachment. Dough should not be sticky and should pull away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is sticky, add a few tablespoons of flour.\nPlace dough in a well-oiled, covered bowl and let rise in a warm place (recommended: on top of or inside an oven that is off) for 1 hour. This a great time to make your toppings! See the recipes below. To continue the pretzels:\nPreheat oven to 450\u2109. Spray workspace with cooking spray. Unwrap the dough, which should have doubled in size, and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll dough out into long strands that are about the thickness of your finger and 3 feet long. Grab dough by ends and twist around itself three times. Then, fold the dough on top of itself, forming a pretzel. Watch the video above to see how it's done!\nDip pretzels into the hot water and baking soda mixture, then place on baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Sprinkle rock salt or cinnamon sugar on top.\nPlace pretzels into preheated oven for 12 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn pretzels halfway through to ensure even cooking.\nAfter the pretzels have slightly cooled, brush them with melted butter.\nTop with sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate drizzle, white chocolate drizzle, a smearing of hot fudge, M&Ms, caramel sauce, mint chips, chocolate chips, miniature marshmallows, nuts (peanuts), toffee nuts (candied pecans), coconut, peanut butter drizzle, crushed Oreos, multi-colored jimmies (sprinkles), cotton candy bits, and a gentle snowfall of powdered sugar.",

    "raw_procedure": "In a large non-reactive (stainless steel, enameled cast iron) pot, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Brown the sausage, beef, and veal in batches until well browned and fond has formed on the bottom of the pot. Set meat aside. Heat olive oil in the pot until shimmering - add garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until soft.  Add onions and tomato paste, saut\u00e9 until onions are translucent. Deglaze with wine, making sure to scrape up all the fond on the bottom of the pot. Pour in tomatoes, crushing with a spoon (or processing beforehand with a food mill if desired), and return meats to the pot. Add basil and carrot, and bring to a bare simmer.\nLet sauce simmer on low heat for about 4 hours total, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally (don't let anything stick - it will scorch and ruin your sauce). Add meatballs during the final hour of cooking.\nDiscard carrots and beef/veal bones - add a spoonful of sauce to coat some freshly-cooked pasta (preferably something with ridges so it holds onto lots of sauce), and stir in butter or olive oil for a richer sauce.  Top with extra meat and gravy, parmesan cheese if desired, and serve.\nSauce freezes and reheats exceptionally for up to 2 months.",

    "raw_procedure": "Place all purpose flour on cutting board. Create trench within the flour mound and pour in a few tablespoons of the ice water. Carefully combine the ice water and flour. Then, reform the trench and begin the process again. Once the flour combination becomes chunky, use a bench scraper to help combine the water and flour. Repeat and keep mixing the water and flour until a dough that holds its shape forms. Form the dough into a square, wrap in plastic wrap, and place in the fridge. Chill for 30 minutes.\nCube the sticks of butter and place in the middle of a floured cutting board, then sprinkle flour on top. Taking a floured rolling pin, pound the butter together into one mass. Keep re-flouring the rolling pin and work surface. Keep pounding the butter until it is pliable and can be folded. Then, form the butter into a square, wrap with plastic wrap, and place in fridge for 10 minutes.\nGenerously flour your work surface, take the dough out of the fridge and start rolling out your sticky lean dough into a 12x12 inch square. Then, pound your butter square out so it is approximately a 6x6 inch square.\nPlace the butter square in the middle of the dough square and fold the edges of the dough square so they meet in the middle. Seal the edges of the dough square and roll out the square. Roll the dough out to a 12-inch long and 5-inch wide rectangle.\nFold the rectangle into thirds, like a letter, and then rotate it 90 degrees. Roll out again and repeat once more. Then, fold the dough back into thirds, wrap with plastic wrap, and place the dough into the fridge for 30 minutes. This allows the glutens to relax. Watch the video above to see this process!\nAfter 30 minutes has passed, pull the dough out of the fridge and roll out. Fold into thirds and roll once more. Repeat this once more and then fold into thirds, wrap in plastic wrap, and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Repeat this whole rolling process once more to create 6 total folds and 720 layers of butter. Again, watch the video to see this in action!\nFold into thirds and wrap in plastic wrap. Place the dough in the fridge for at least one hour and up to 24 hours. Next, begin preparing the beef tenderloin and mushroom duxelles.",

Using a spoon, scoop and pour the butter over the steak to baste it.\nRemove steak from the heat. Add a generous pat of butter to the top of the steak to form a butter blanket. Take the garlic clove and thyme sprig from the skillet and place on top of the steak. Cover with aluminum foil. Allow the steak to take a little nap for 10 minutes.\nAfter ten minutes have passed, remove tin foil and proceed with carving. Using a large knife, carefully cut the bone away from the rest of the steak. Then, slice steak into 2 inch slices, fan to make it look pretty, and then eat.",

Remove the ribs from the freezer and place on the wire rack. Cover the ribs and the baking sheet with aluminum foil. Tightly cover and make sure smoke can\u2019t get out.\nCook for 30 minutes before removing the pan, lowering the heat to 250\u00b0F, and pouring a beer into the corner of the baking sheet. Place back in the oven for 1 \u00bd hours.\nDuring the last 30 minutes of cooking, make a simple barbecue sauce by heating some vegetable oil over medium heat and then adding all the ingredients of the barbeque sauce. Whisk to combine and then let sit on a low heat to stay warm.\nRemove the ribs from the oven when they are done cooking, and coat one side with your homemade bbq sauce. Place under a broiler for 5-7 minutes or until brown and caramelized. Do the same to the other side of the ribs.\nRemove the bones from the ribs and now it\u2019s time to plate up. Add the ribs to the bun and top with more barbecue sauce. Top with diced onion and pickles. Serve and enjoy!",

Then, add the finely minced onion to the pan. Use a flat wooden spoon or a rubber spatula and allow it to sweat for 1 to 2 minutes until it is just beginning to turn translucent.\nTo the large saucepan, add 2 cups of Arborio or carnaroli rice and toast it in the pan with the onion for 1 to 2 minutes until the edges of the grains of rice turn translucent. At this point, add 1 cup of dry white wine and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes until the alcohol is cooked off.\nStart adding your stock, which should be a golden brown color, 1 to 2 ladlefuls at a time. Once you have added enough stock to mostly saturate the rice, stir relatively frequently until you can drag your spoon across the bottom of the pot and leave a trail. Add 1 to 2 more ladlefuls of hot stock and repeat the process over medium heat until you have added anywhere from 3 to 3 \u00bd cups worth of stock and the rice is creamy and tender, but slightly al dente.\nTurn off the heat and add a gracious amount of freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese as well as 2 to 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter.\nAfter adding the bone marrow interiors to the pan, season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.

Once browned and broken up into tiny pieces, transfer to a plate and set aside.\nNext dice \u00bd a cup of celery, and \u00bc cup of red onion Saut\u00e9 in the same pan you cooked the sausage in for about 3-4 minutes.\nCut up 5 cups of cornbread into bite sized pieces and add them to a large bowl along with your red onion, celery, cooked pork sausage, 1 \u00bd cups of chicken stock, and \u00bd cup of cranberries. Mix to combine.\nNext you want to debone your turkey. Start at the backbone on one side of the turkey and make shallow cuts around the carcass until you reach the breast bone. Repeat on the other side of the turkey. Then, being very careful, continue to make small shallow cuts, making sure not to pierce the skin. Separate the breastbone from the turkey. Leave the wing and leg bones in, but remove the thigh bone.\nMake sure the meat of the turkey is dispersed evenly. If needed, give it a good pound with a mallet or the bottom of a pan to even everything out.\nLiberally season with salt and pepper, and then add your stuffing mixture. Fold the turkey in on itself and then tie tightly with butcher twine at one inch intervals up the length of the turkey. Also tie the drumsticks together and then cut off the excess twine. Season the exterior liberally with salt and pepper. Also cover with some vegetable oil to help the skin brown.\nPlace the turkey in a pan and tuck the wing tips underneath the body and wrap the drumsticks in a little bit of foil.\nPlace in the oven at 450\u00b0F for 15 minutes and then turn the temperature down to 350\u00b0F and cook for 1 \u00bd - 2 hours or until the thickest part of the stuffing registers 155\u00b0F.\nRemove from the pan and place on a wire rack to rest for 30 minutes.\nSlice the turkey and top with gravy that was made from the carcass which you can learn to do HERE.\nServe and enjoy!",

In the mixing bowl you can also add the salt, pepper, brown sugar, maple syrup, marjoram, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, nutmeg, and smoked paprika. Stir to combine.\nRemove pork from the freezer and add to the mixing bowl. Using your hands, mix everything together until it\u2019s all well incorporated.\nUsing your meat grinder, put the pork through at the grind of your choice, making sure the meat stays cold so it doesn\u2019t clog the grinder.\nOnce all of your meat is ground, remove sausage casings from the packaging, rinse the salt and off of them and then soak in warm water for 45 minutes.\nWhen the casings are ready, thread them onto your sausage stuffer, leaving about 6 inches off of the end. Start slowly by regulating how much you\u2019re putting through until you get the hang of it and then slowly pick up speed.\nOnce all of the meat is cased, figure out your desired sausage length, and pinch, squeeze and turn to make links.\nFry the links up in a pan on a medium-high heat until cooked through.",

Knead until sore, or when the dough has the consistency of play dough.\nWrap the dough TIGHTLY in plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for at least thirty minutes.\nAfter thirty minutes, unwrap the dough and start flouring everything - your hands, the dough, the rolling pin, the countertop, and anything else you think needs flouring around you.\nOnce finished flouring, cut the dough down the center into two halves.\nAt least laminate the dough before running through the pasta machine.\nWith the pasta machine on its widest setting it\u2019s time to start running it through.\nThis machine\u2019s widest setting is a 7 and we want to get it down to a 2, so this means running it through at least 4 to 5 times.\nThis means that the dough will start to get a little long, so I recommend cutting it into two pieces and work those individually.\nOnce the dough has been rolled/thinned down to a 2, dust your dough with some flour before running through the pasta machine and making some linguini.\nMake sure that they noodles do not stick to each other after running through the blades, and then toss your noodles with some more flour to ensure no sticking.\nPlace and keep under a plastic wrap, or a ziploc bag and frozen until you are ready to use.\nEnjoy!",

Keep the tail or cut it off, depending on the method you\u2019re using to cook the shrimp.\nDevein the shrimp by placing a slice down the back of the shrimp, revealing its intestine. Remove the vein with the back of a small knife.\nRepeat these two steps until you are finished peeling and deveining all of your shrimp. Be sure to hold onto the peeled shells for later because they are full of shrimp flavor to make a great stock.",

    "raw_procedure": "Line two flat rimmed baking sheets or large square or rectangular platters with a layer of plastic cling wrap and set aside. In a small bowl or cup, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and allow it to hydrate, about 1 minute. Meanwhile, heat evaporated milk in a small saucepan over medium high heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula to prevent burning on the bottom of the pan. When milk comes to a simmer, add hydrated gelatin and stir until melted. Remove pan from heat.\nAdd cheese all at once and stir with a whisk to combine. Return pan to low heat and continue to whisk until mixture is homogeneous and registers between 160 and 170\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer. Beat with the blade of an immersion blender directly in the pot until glossy and smooth. Alternatively, transfer to the bowl of a blender or food processor and blend, starting at the lowest speed and slowly increasing to the highest. Blend for 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides as necessary. If necessary, blend in two separate batches, pouring first half onto lined sheet tray before proceeding to second half (see step 3).\nPour mixture out of the blender and onto the prepared baking sheets. You should end up with a layer a few millimeters thick on each tray. Use a rubber spatula to distribute the cheese in an even layer. Transfer to a flat place in the refrigerator and allow to cool until firm to the touch, at least ten minutes (you may need longer depending on how cold your fridge it, how thick your plates or trays are, and how well your fridge circulates air).\nWhen cheese has cooled, carefully lift the plastic wrap and transfer the whole thing to a cutting board. Cut the cheese into slices.",

Put fermentation weights on top of the cabbage to keep everything under the brine.\nTo make the pickling brine, combine 2 \u00bd Tbsp of kosher salt and 4 cups of water. Stir until everything is dissolved and then pour on top of potatoes.\nCover the mason jars with some airlock lids, or use a glass bowl and some plastic wrap. Let sit for three straight days.\nAfter the 3 days, drain and then boil your baby potatoes until they are toothsome (10-15 minutes). Let cool.\nAs the potatoes cool, combine the following in a bowl: \u00bd of one red onion (chopped), 2-3 Tbsp of sour cream, 3 Tbsp of freshly chopped dill, 1-2 Tbsp of white wine vinegar, a few pinches of kosher salt, some freshly ground pepper, some thinly sliced scallions, some finely chopped chives, 1\u00bd Tbsp olive oil, and 1 large Tbsp of whole grain mustard.\nAdd the boiled and cooled potatoes to the mixture.

    "raw_procedure": "In a large bowl, whisk together flours. Create a well in the center of the flours, and crack 4 of the eggs inside. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the salt, gradually adding more and more flour, until a thick slurry is formed.  Begin kneading flour into the mixture with your hands, until a shaggy dough forms - turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, or until smooth and not tacky.  Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. NOTE: If you\u2019re using a pasta extruder like in the video, you want a particularly dry dough - slightly rough to the touch (it will be kneaded further by the hopper). Add more flour as necessary.\nUsing a pasta extruder, feed golfball-sized pieces of dough into the hopper with the stand mixer on high speed. Toss the pasta with flour before arranging into nests on a floured baking sheet, covering with plastic wrap, and refrigerating until ready to use (pasta freezes very well also).\nBring a pot of salted water to boil.  In a large frying pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Cut the guanciale into lardons, and fry in the vegetable oil until crisp. As the guanciale finishes cooking, add the pasta to the boiling water and boil for 2-3 minutes, or until al dente.  Add the minced garlic to the guanciale, and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Using tongs, remove the pasta from the pot, and place in the hot skillet (make sure you don\u2019t drain the pasta too well, you want about 1/4 cup of pasta water to end up in the skillet).  Remove the pan from the heat and toss the spaghetti with the guanciale.  Whisk together the two remaining eggs and, stirring constantly, add to the hot pasta, and stir until thickened.  Toss with 1 cup of parmesan, season with pepper (and salt if necessary), and plate, topping with freshly grated parmesan.",

    "raw_ingredient_list": "7 ounces all purpose flour (plus more for dusting)\n7 ounces semolina flour\n6 large eggs, divided\n1 tsp salt\n2 Tbsp vegetable oil\n6 large shiitake mushrooms, brushed clean, chopped\n2-3 cloves garlic, minced\n1/2 cup grated rennet-free parmesan (plus more for sprinkling)\n1/2 cup smoked provolone\nFreshly ground pepper",
    "raw_procedure": "In a large bowl, whisk together flours. Create a well in the center of the flours, and crack 4 of the eggs inside. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the salt, gradually adding more and more flour, until a thick slurry is formed.  Begin kneading flour into the mixture with your hands, until a shaggy dough forms - turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, or until smooth and not tacky. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. NOTE: If you\u2019re using a pasta extruder like in the video, you want a particularly dry dough - slightly rough to the touch (it will be kneaded further by the hopper).  Add more flour as necessary.\nUsing a pasta extruder, feed golfball-sized pieces of dough into the hopper with the stand mixer on high speed. Toss the pasta with flour before arranging into nests on a floured baking sheet, covering with plastic wrap, and refrigerating until ready to use (pasta freezes very well also).\nBring a pot of salted water to the boil. In a large frying pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium flame. Saut\u00e9 the shiitake mushrooms until golden - as the mushrooms finish cooking, add the pasta to the boiling water and boil for 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. Add the minced garlic to the mushrooms, and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Using tongs, remove the pasta from the pot, and place in the hot skillet (make sure you don\u2019t drain the pasta too well, you want about 1/4 cup of pasta water to end up in the skillet). Remove the pan from the heat and toss the spaghetti with the mushrooms. Whisk together the two remaining eggs and, stirring constantly, add to the hot pasta, and stir until thickened. Toss with cheeses, season with pepper (and salt if necessary), and plate, topping with freshly grated parmesan.",

    "raw_procedure": "In a stand mixer bowl, put in 2 \u00bd cups flour, create a well in the center, and crack in 4 large eggs along with 1 Tbsp of black squid ink. Gently beat that into the flour with a fork until a thick slurry is formed. Attach a dough hook and beat at medium to medium-low speed for 8-10 minutes. Add more flour or water as necessary until a smooth and tacky but not sticky dough is formed. Wrap in plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. If you\u2019ve never had a wedding registry, then you probably don\u2019t have a stand mixer, in which case you can knead the dough with your hands.\nAfter the dough has rested in plastic wrap, cut it into four equal parts, and wrap remaining three while working with the first quarter. Dust the dough liberally with flour, roll it out a bit, and pass it through the stand mixer roller on its widest setting. Laminate the dough by folding into thirds, then putting it through the roller again for 3-6 times, adding flour as necessary until the right consistency is achieved. Start rolling thinner and thinner until it is at the second to thinnest setting. Attach spaghetti cutter and roll through, lifting pasta away while gently twisting it into a loose knot to avoid tangling the pasta. Place on a rimmed baking sheet that\u2019s covered in flour and repeat until all dough is in spaghetti strands. Cover in plastic wrap and place in fridge until it\u2019s ready to be cooked.\nOpen can of tomato puree, finely mince half a shallot, and peel one large clove of garlic to be crushed. In a high-walled saute pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil until it is shimmering. Dump in finely minced shallot and saute for about a minute. Then add in the crushed clove of garlic and sprinkle in some red pepper flakes if you want some heat. Let those flavors get to know each other for no longer than one minute before adding \u00bc cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc). Add 2 tablespoons of tomato puree and simmer until white wine has evaporated which will be 3-5 minutes.\nDuring this, cook the pasta, which will only take about 1 minute because fresh pasta cooks very quickly. While the pasta is in the boiling water for no more than 90 seconds, add 2 Tbsps of black squid ink to the pasta sauce. When pasta is done add it directly to the sauce along with a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water which will help make it more cohesive and smooth. Rigorously mix and toss pasta to make it nice and creamy. Season with kosher salt if needed. Plate and enjoy!",

Strain the peas. Melt \u00bd a stick of butter in a pan and then add 1 chopped shallot. Saute for 2 minutes and then add peas. When peas are tender add 2 Tbsp of chopped mint, and the zest of one lemon. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine.\nPat the steaks dry and then add them to a hot skillet with vegetable oil. Pan sear the steaks for about 4 minutes per side over a medium high heat. Add \u00bd a stick of butter and baste the steaks until they reach your desired internal temperature. Set aside and let rest for 10 minutes.\nWipe out the pan and then add your crushed peppercorns. Toast for about 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and add \u00bd a cup of cognac. Once the alcohol has cooked out, add \u00bd cup beef stock (before using, boil down 1 cup of beef stock to \u00bd a cup of beef stock) along with \u00bd cup of heavy cream. Whisk to combine. Keep stirring and simmering until it thickens up and then add 2 Tbsp of butter. Mix to combine.\nAdd steak, peas, and carrots to a plate. Top steak with sauce, serve and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "In a medium bowl, place bread flour and make a little well in the middle. In that well, pour vegetable oil, egg whites, salt, and lemon juice. Give this a little mix with your hands until it just barely comes together. Add warm water and mix with hands until it forms a semi-cohesive dough. Add flour if too sticky, but not too much.\nFlour your worktop and just knead the hell out of the dough. Seriously, pound it against the table. Take your frustrations out on the dough until you end up with a soft and supple dough. When finished, place in an oiled bowl and let rest for 30 minutes.\nPeel and finely chop the apples. Place them in a large bowl and season with sugar, cinnamon, raisins, lemon zest, and lemon juice (if you want to prevent the apples from browning). Add a few tablespoons of flour to soak up the moisture. Allow to rest for 30 minutes.\nCover table in large, clean tablecloth and liberally dust with flour. Plop down your dough and dust your rolling pin with flour. Roll out until it is a large circle, about 18-24 inches wide. Dust your knuckles and carefully pick up your dough. Rotate the dough with your fists carefully, like a fragile pizza pie. Get it as large as you can without tearing it and then set it down. Slowly tug at the edges until it is thin enough so you can see the pattern of the tablecloth through the dough. Slice the rough edges off.\nUsing a pastry brush, drizzle the dough with the melted butter. Gently brush the butter so every square inch is covered with melted butter. Sprinkle the chopped walnuts and hazelnuts all over the buttered dough.\nPlace a generous row of the spiced apples at the end of the dough square. Using the tablecloth, roll the dough onto itself. Tuck the edges and brush with some more butter. Repeat until the strudel is all rolled up. Seal the edges.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Place strudel on parchment lined baking sheet and brush down with beaten egg. Place in the oven. Every ten minutes, brush the strudel with melted butter. It should bake for about an hour or until golden brown. Leave on a wire rack to cool.\nAfter cooled, cut into the strudel. Dust the piece with powder sugar and don\u2019t forget the whipped cream.",

    "raw_procedure": "NOTE: It\u2019s recommended to remove the corn husk (as corn husks are inedible), and omit the blueberry pancake all together.  Additionally, if you want more compatible flavors, substitute chorizo for the merguez, additional monterey jack for the gruyere, and skip the pico de gallo/baking step.  Frying this taco is dangerous - make sure to use extra long/wide tongs, protective gloves, and extreme caution when lowering it into the hot oil.  Better yet, just don\u2019t make this thing at all please.\nBrown the ground beef and add the taco seasoning, along with 2-3 tablespoons of water, as per package instructions.\nHeat very large pot of oil (at least 15 inches in diameter) to 350\u00b0F.  Begin assembling the taco: start by filling a crunchy taco shell with ground beef, and topping with lettuce, tomatoes, southwestern sauce, and nacho cheese.  Spread refried beans on a flour tortilla, and wrap around taco shell.  Place monterey jack cheese on a toasted corn tortilla, and wrap that around the flour tortilla.  Fill a chalupa shell with guacamolito sauce and place the multi-layered taco inside.  Place the chalupa taco into a corn husk, and top with pico de gallo - bake in a 350\u00b0F oven for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, cover a single crepe with scrambled eggs, merguez sausage, and gruyere cheese.  Take the taco out of the oven, remove the corn husk, and wrap inside the crepe.  Place the crepe-taco onto the meat lovers pizza, wrap it around the taco, and finish by wrapping the blueberry pancake around the pizza.  Press together as tightly as possible without breaking any of the layers. Secure with long wooden skewers, and using a wide casserole filled with some beer batter, cover the entire taco in batter.  Using extreme caution, place the battered taco in the hot oil, basting with a metal ladle if not completely covered by the oil.  Fry for 10 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy all over.  Remove from the oil and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.  Fill a canvas bag with vegetarian chili, and place the taco inside.  Enjoy?",

After at least 3 hours place the pork in a dish and cook in the oven at 275\u00b0 for 3 hours.\nIn a bowl combine 560g of masa harina with 700ml of hot water. Give a good mix with a wooden spoon until a crumbly dough forms. Set aside and let it rest for 15 minutes.\nIn a stand mixer, whip 375g of lard for 2 minutes until it\u2019s light and fluffy. Add 1 \u00bd tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of kosher salt. Mix to combine before adding our soaked masa. Slowly add while scraping down the sides with a spoon, and then slowly add 1 cup of warm chicken stock. Mix to combine. Let the tamale dough rest in the fridge for at least one hour.\nTake pork mixture out of the oven and shred it with a fork, and add some of the marinade back to the pork.\nRoast some poblano peppers on your stovetop, wrap them in foil, and let them steam in there before we peel them.\nOnce they\u2019ve steamed, peel the blackened char off the peppers and slice them into strips.\nTake your corn husk, open it up, and spread your tamale dough in a relatively thin and even layer over the top half of the corn husk leaving a 2 inch border on each side. Stuff with your fillings, and roll together so that the two sides of the tamale dough meet in the middle. Fold up the tapered end of the corn husk, and with 2 small strips of corn husks, tie together in the center. Repeat for however many tamales you would like to make. This recipe calls for two kinds of tamales, one with peppers and cheese, the other with your pork.\nPlace all the tamales standing up in the steam basket of a large pot. Cover the top of the tamales with some corn husks to help concentrate the steam in the steamer. Add about 2 cups of water, and cook for about 45 minutes.\nOnce you remove the tamales from the pot, let them rest for 30 minutes before digging in.\nRemove the corn husk and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Start by removing the rib roast from the bone. Next, using a sharp knife, make some shallow cuts in the fat of the beef to score it. Set aside.\nGrind up 1 Tbsp dried rosemary and 1 Tbsp dried thyme until they are almost a powder and then add some kosher salt, freshly ground pepper and optionally some garlic and onion powder. Give it a little mix and then liberally rub all over your rib roast.\nPlace your roast back on top of the bones, and using butcher\u2019s twine, tie them back to each other so the bones can serve as a natural roasting rack.\nPreheat the oven to 500\u00b0F.\nPlace your roast in a pan and rub down with olive oil. Once it\u2019s covered, insert a temperature probe into the thickest part of the roast. Place in the oven for 25 minutes and then turn the temperature down to 300\u00b0F. Continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches 115\u00b0F.\nOnce cooked, remove from the pan, put on a plate, and cover with aluminum foil. Make sure the probe remains in the roast. Set aside for 15 minutes.\nPlace the pan over a medium high heat and make sure there is about \u2153 of a cup of fat left in the pan. If there is more, pour it into a bowl and set aside. Add 1 Tbsp of all purpose flour and whisk for about 2-3 minutes, then add 32 ounces of high quality beef stock to the pan. Whisk frequently and boil down to your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.\nOnce your meat has reached an internal temperature of 130\u00b0F, remove the aluminum foil and you\u2019re left with perfect medium rare beef. Cover the meat and place in the fridge overnight to make for easier slicing.\nRemove meat from the fridge and cut into thin slices. Bring your gravy/sauce to a slight boil and place your beef in the sauce and let sit for a minute.\nRemove your roasted peppers from the jar and place in a bowl. Combine with 3-4 cloves of garlic along with some olive oil and a little bit of kosher salt. Let chill in the fridge if you have time.\nNext, take your baguette and slice lengthwise. Place some fresh mozzarella on the bread along with your roasted red peppers and your roast beef.\nPour some of your sauce into a small bowl for dipping.\nServe and enjoy!",

Roughly 1\u00bd - 2 minutes.\nFlip the steak and make sure everything is crisp.\nAdd 2 to 3 Tbsp of butter to the pan, along with 1 clove of garlic and a whole sprig of rosemary.\nGently lift the pan to an angle creating a \u201cbutter pool\u201d and scooping it up and pouring it over the steak with a spoon (butter basing).\nFlip once more, making sure everything is crisp, and continue to butter baste the other side for another 90 seconds.\nOnce both sides have been generously butter basted, sear all the rendered fat on the side of the steak for about 60 seconds until the fat turns golden brown.\nLet rest for no longer than 5 minutes with the garlic and thyme on top. Cover with foil.\nRun a chef\u2019s knife on the side of the bone (hold on to for future beef stock).\nCarve the steak straight down into thick pieces.",

Finely chop some basil and add that to the mixture along with salt, pepper, and a little freshly grated nutmeg. Mix to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to be used.\nRoll out your dough either by hand or by using a pasta-making KitchenAid attachment. It should be in one long thing strip (mine was on the second thinnest setting). Cut out small rounds from the sheet of dough. Reuse leftover dough for more rounds. Fill each round of dough with about a teaspoon of your cheese mixture. Use some water to wet the edges and then fold over and seal with the other side. Grab both corners and bring them together in the middle to make that tortellini shape. Do that for as many tortellini as you\u2019d like to make.\nCook in boiling water for 3-5 minutes and then place a few tortellini in each bowl for serving.\nFill each bowl with either beef, chicken, or veal broth - just enough to cover the pasta.

Whisk dry ingredients together and set aside.\nPlace 1 \u00bd sticks of unsalted butter (room temperature), 300 grams of granulated sugar, and 50 grams of glucose syrup. If you are unable to access glucose syrup, you can use light corn syrup, but it will not have the same consistency in the end.\nBeat this mixture together with a stand-up mixer on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes or until the texture is light and fluffy.\nScrape down the sides of the bowl and add 260 grams of creamy peanut butter and beat on medium-high speed for 30 seconds or until combined.\nWith the mixer running on slow, add 2 large eggs one at a time until being combined for about 30 seconds.\nAdd \u00bd gram of vanilla extract before beating on high-speed for 3 minutes until the mixture is light, creamy, and doubled in volume.\nAdd your pre-combined dry ingredients after scraping down the bowl one more time. Mix minimally on low-speed for about 30 seconds.\nCaramelize some granulated sugar over medium-low heat until amber in color. Pour it on parchment paper and allow to cool completely before peeling away from the parchment and smashing into tiny bits. None of the bits should be larger than a grain of rice. Dump into the cookie dough mixture.\nChop up about 4-6 ounces of high quality dark chocolate and add to the mixture. Slowly and gently mix together to evenly incorporate the mix-ins.\nUse a tiny ice cream scoop or melon baller to scoop out uniform little nubbins (2-3 tablespoons worth) of the cookie dough. Space out your scoops evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet.\nPat down the tops of the scoops a little bit to make the scoops into evenly proportioned chubby little disks.\nStack and wrap the cookie dough in plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge for as little as three hours and as much as three days. The longer you let the cookie dough sit, the better it is going to look and taste.\nOnce finished chilling, unwrap and place in a 375\u00b0F oven for 15-18 minutes until they are golden brown and crisp.",

Set the yolks aside.\nBeat the whites on high speed with the whisk attachment of the stand mixer while slowly adding 1 cup of white sugar. Keep whipping until stiff peaks form.\nIn a separate stand mixer bowl, beat the egg yolks with the other cup of sugar, mixing on medium speed with the paddle attachment for about 2 minutes - until pale and smooth.\nIn a separate bowl, combine all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine.\nAdd 2/3 cup milk to the egg yolk mixture along with 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Mix until completely combined. Next, add the bowl of dry ingredients and mix until completely combined.\nNext, add the egg white meringue to the other bowl. Gently stir to combine, being careful not to deflate the egg whites.\nPrepare your baking pans. First, cut your parchment paper into rounds for the bottom of your pan. Watch the video to see how I do it! Then, grease both pans with vegetable oil.\nPour the batter evenly between the two pans. Spread to smooth out the top.\nBake at 350\u00b0F for 25-35 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.\nWhile the cake is baking, make the dulce de leche.\nOnce the cakes have cooled, remove them from pan and remove parchment paper. Put the cakes back in their respective pans. Poke holes along the top of both cakes with a fork.\nIn a bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk.\nLadle the tres leches mixture over top of the cakes. Cover the cakes and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.\nPlace one later cake onto a cake stand or plate.  Cover with whipped cream all over. Top with a drizzle of dulce de leche, and then garnish with sliced strawberries. Serve and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "First, loosen the skin from the turkey. Combine \u00bc cup of kosher salt with 1 Tbsp of black pepper. Rub about \u00be of that mixture under the skin. Then add 1 \u00bd tsp of baking soda to the salt and pepper mixture and cover the outside of the turkey.\nOnce fully coated, let rest uncovered in the fridge for 24 hours.\nLine the inside of the turkey with a few layers of cheesecloth. Add your stuffing (recipe below) and then tie the cheesecloth shut. Also tie the legs.\nRoll 4 large cylinders of aluminum foil. Place three of them widthwise and 1 lengthwise onto your pan - this will hold the turkey up.\nPlace the turkey breast-side down onto the cylinders and top the turkey with 1 pack of bacon. Cook in a preheated 325\u00b0F oven. When the turkey has reached 130\u00b0F, remove from the oven.\nRemove bacon from the turkey.\nWhile the turkey cooks, chop up your turnips, parsnips, and carrots and add them to a bowl along with your red pearl onions. Season with salt and pepper and top with vegetable oil. Toss to combine.\nOn a rimmed baking sheet add your turnip, parsnip, carrot and onion mixture and place a wire rack on top.\nThe turkey should already be cooked to 130\u00b0F. Flip turkey so it\u2019s breast-side up and place on the wire rack on top of the vegetable mixture.\nRemove stuffing from the turkey and then brush down turkey with clarified butter.\nPlace back in the oven, and increase the temperature to 400\u00b0F and cook for an additional 45 minutes, or until the thickest part of the breast registers 160\u00b0F.\nRemove from oven and let the turkey rest for 30 minutes.\nStrain any juice in the baking sheet to help make gravy.\nPlace the tray of veggies back in the oven for 20 minutes.\nCarve the turkey and serve with everything else and enjoy!",

    "raw_procedure": "Begin by not only de-boning the turkey, but removing the meat and trying to keep as much of the skin as intact as possible. This will ease the process of making a turkey roulade, which will allow us to stuff the turkey with even more turkey. Follow the video if you want to try to do this!\nTaking the dark meat, trim off the gristle and fat from the thigh as well as the drumstick. Cut into 1-inch cubes and place on a parchment lined baking sheet or plate to be chilled in the freezer for 15 to 25 minutes until just starting to turn firm around the edges. Put your food processor blade in the freezer as well. This will make the meat a whole lot easier to grind.\nPlace the blade and the dark meat into the food processor and pulse repeatedly until you end up with a nice and finely textured dark meat ground turkey sausage mixture. Dump the meat out into a bowl.\nFor flavor, add some finely chopped fresh herbs including a packed tablespoon of sage, \u00bd a teaspoon of finely minced thyme, and a teaspoon of finely minced rosemary. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and then add a little bit of freshly grated nutmeg and a clove or two of freshly grated garlic. Mix together with your hands until all of the herbs and spices are evenly distributed.\nTaking the breast, remove the tender from the bottom and trim off any fat or gristle. \u201cButterfly\u201d the breast so that it is nice and thin for the roulade. Cover with plastic wrap and pound it with either a meat mallet or a frying pan until it is completely flat. For the resemblance of a rectangle, trim and \u201cbutterfly\u201d the tender and use it to patch the corner of the breast.\nEvenly spread the turkey sausage mixture over the top of the flat tender, pat it down, and begin rolling it up starting with the side that has been patched so that it all stays together.\nFlatten out the skin until it is as flat and stretched as possible. Place the roulade in the very center with the seam facing upward. Wrap it in the skin, trim off any excess, and begin to tie. Tie it every 1 to 2 inches and make sure to tie it tighter towards the thicker part of the breast for a more even roulade that cooks more evenly. Rub the roulade down with olive oil, season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.\nOnce the roulade is nice and evenly seasoned, roast at 400\u00b0F until the thickest part of the roulade registers to about 160\u00b0F. Allow it to rest uncovered for 20 minutes to prevent the skin from getting flabby.\nCarve and serve as desired, top it off with some gravy that is made from the homemade stock, and add a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy!",

Place beef balls (4 ounces of beef, divided into two balls) several inches apart in skillet, and smash down using a large, flat spatula.  Use a rolling pin or the handle of another spatula to press the burgers firmly down, until they are thin and craggly. Cook for approximately 60 seconds, until the bottom is charred and crispy.  Flip, and immediately top with cheese. Remove from heat, but leave burgers in the pan while you assemble, so the cheese melts completely.\nPlace one burger in a bun on the bottom, top with large stuffed burger, top that with some Himalayan Ketchup, and top that with the other burger.\nServe and enjoy!",

Use your slider buns as a template, but make each patty slightly larger than the bun to account for shrinkage.\nOnce all 6 patties are scored, use a metal straw to punch out 5 holes from each patty. Place the tray of meat into the freezer to firm up.\nDice 2 onions. Coat the bottom of your cast iron skillet with vegetable oil. Add your onions in an even letter on the bottom of the skillet. Pour in a little water over top to help the onions steam. Stir and sweat the onions for 2-3 minutes in the pan.\nOnce the beef patties are frozen, break them apart into individual patties.\nLay the 6 beef patties on top of the onions, leaving as little room between burgers as possible. Top each burger with a little bit of kosher salt.\nAdd the bottom bun directly onto the top of each patty (yes, before you\u2019ve flipped it). Then place the top bun on top of the bottom bun. This will help steam the buns.\nRemove the top buns and set aside. Invert the 6 burgers onto a plate or wire-rimmed baking sheet.

Make sure they are fully coated and then set onto a plate.\nOnce all of your shrimp are coated, add vegetable oil to a pot and bring to 375\u00b0F. Add shrimp and cook each shrimp for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oil and set on a paper towel.\nFor the butter sauce, add 1 small minced shallot to a pan along with 2 Tbsp white wine, 2 Tbsp white wine vinegar, and 1-2 Tbsp of heavy cream.\nCook over a medium heat until almost all the liquid has entirely reduced and then turn the heat down to a low heat. Add 1 cup of butter, a few chunks at a time. Once all the butter is added, remove from the heat but keep whisking to combine until a thick smooth sauce has been created.\nFor the white chocolate sauce, follow all the steps above but instead of 1 cup of butter, just add 4 ounces of butter along with 4 ounces of white chocolate. Mix to combine. If the sauce starts to break, just add a few Tbsp of heavy cream.\nServe with the fried shrimp and enjoy!",

Add fresh parsley, thyme, and soaked porcini mushrooms, and simmer for 30 minutes, diluting with remaining chicken stock (or more if desired) if mushrooms are too strong.\nPour soup into the jar of a high-powered blender, and season with salt and pepper.  Blend until nearly smooth, stop the blender, and add torn bread pieces.  Turn the blender on high, and while running, stream remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in through the top, until soup is creamy and emulsified.\nIn 4 warm, shallow soup bowls, pile a handful of wild mushrooms in the center of each bowl.  Pour soup around the mushrooms, until soup comes halfway up their side.

Whisk to combine.\nIn the same bowl add 3 large egg yolks and the milk and yeast mixture. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix dough together until it forms a large shaggy mass. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8 minutes. Once dough is smooth, add to an oiled bowl, cover, and let sit for about an hour or until it\u2019s doubled in size.\nTurn dough out onto a floured work surface, pat with a little bit of flour, and then roll out to about \u00bd inch thickness. Then use a biscuit cutter dusted with flour to cut the dough into donut rounds and place them on a rimmed floured baking sheet. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes.\nHeat up vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet to 350\u00b0F.\nAdd donuts to the oil and cook for about 45 seconds per side. Remove from oil and place on a wire rack to let cool. Before half of the donuts cool completely, coat them in sugar.\nOnce cooled, take the donuts that are not covered in sugar and using a paring knife make an entry point into the side of the donut and add your cream with a piping bag. Once the cream is added, dip half the donut into the chocolate and let sit for about 20 minutes to harden.\nOn the sugar donuts, make an entry point with a paring knife and add some seedless raspberry jam with a piping bag.\nServe and enjoy!",

    "raw_ingredient_list": "2 lbs ground beef\n1 yellow onion, diced\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 Tbsp salt\n1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n2 Tbsp chili powder\n1 Tbsp cumin\n\u00bd Tbsp brown sugar\n1 cup beef broth\n1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed (optional)\n1 drop Tough Sauce (optional)",
    "raw_procedure": "Heat 1 tsp cooking oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and cook until nicely browned.\nAdd a few tablespoons of olive oil to a large pot. Heat over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook until they start to brown.\nAdd more olive oil and add the garlic. Stir to combine.\nAdd browned beef and 1 tablespoon of salt. Stir to combine.\nAdd the can of crushed tomatoes to the pot. Stir to combine. Turn the heat to medium low.\nAdd chili powder, cumin, brown sugar, and beef broth. Stir to combine.\nCover and simmer on low for 10 minutes.\nIf you want to add beans to your chili, add them now. Stir to combine and then let simmer for 30-60 minutes.\nAdd 250g bread flour, 250g all-purpose flour and 1 \u00bd tsp of kosher salt into a bowl and give a tiny whisk to combine.\nAdd one large beaten egg to the wet ingredients, then pour the dry ingredients into the bowl.\nUsing the stand mixer with a dough hook, mix on low speed for about 1 minute until everything is combined and then on to medium speed for 5 to 8 minutes, until a smooth, tacky, supple, ball of dough forms.\nClean out and lightly oil a bowl and place the dough inside. Let it rise for about one hour or until doubled in size.\nPlace the dough onto the work surface and flour well on both sides. Roll out, divide and shape hotdog buns. Watch the episode for my method!\nPlace them on a parchment-lined baking sheet at least 1 inch apart and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Loosely cover with plastic wrap.\nLet sit until doubled in size.\nBrush down the tops of each bun with a beaten egg.\nBake them in a 350\u00b0F oven for 15 to 25 minutes, or until they emerge golden brown and puffed.\nAllow to cool completely on a wire rack.\nTo assemble cure seasoning mixture, combine sea salt, paprika, garlic powder, ground white pepper, onion powder and pink curing salt.\nWith the grinder running on medium speed, feed the beef and fat through using the finest grinding plates. Every 4 cubes of beef, run a cube of fat through so that the mixture is marbled.\nAdd the cure/spice mixture to the ground beef and mix it together quickly to prevent heating up the beef.\nPut half of your beef mixture and half of your ice into a food processor. Pulse to combine until it is a paste like consistency. The ice and beef should emulsify together. Repeat with the second half of beef and ice. This beef mixture is now \u2018farce.\u2019 Before leaving it to cure, pan fry a little bit of the farce in oil so that you can make sure the salt and seasoning is good. If it is, move on to curing.\nTo cure the farce, put the meat in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly up against the surface of the meat. Keep it in the fridge for 24 hours.\nThread the natural sheep hotdog casing onto the sausage stuffer and stuff with the cold farce and twist into hotdogs. Watch the episode to see how I do this!\nLet the hot dogs sit uncovered in the fridge for a couple hours.\nUsing a stove-top smoker (or your preferred smoking method), smoke the hotdogs with mesquite and hickory wood chips over medium-high heat. Once you see whisps of smoke coming out, lower the heat to medium low and keep the smoker at about  170\u00b0F for 45 minutes. Snip them apart into individual hot dogs.",
