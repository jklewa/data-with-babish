5	Classic Pancakes	\N	10 ounces flour\n3 Tbsp sugar\n4 tsp baking powder\n½ tsp baking soda\n1 tsp salt\n2 large eggs\n¼ cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan\n1 ½ cups whole milk\n½ tsp vanilla extract (optional)\nButter and syrup for serving	In one bowl, combine dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.\nIn another bowl, combine eggs, vegetable oil, and whole milk. Optional: you can also add ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract here. Whisk to combine.\nCombine the two bowls and mix together gently with a rubber spatula. The batter should still be lumpy with a few dry streaks of flour. Don’t overmix the pancakes!\nCover the batter and let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.\nHeat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet.\nLadle one scoop of batter into the skillet and cook for a few minutes. Once bubbles appear on the surface and around the edge of the pancake, cook and flip for a few minutes more.\nStack your pancakes up and serve with syrup and butter if desired. Enjoy!	classicpancakes
6	White Castle Sliders Classic Version	\N	6 ounces ground beef\n6 potato slider buns\n2 white onions, diced\nVegetable oil\nKosher salt\n6 slices American cheese, trimmed to size of slider\n6 dill pickle chips (or more to taste)	Put ground beef in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat to reach a more paste-like consistency, which will make tighter patties.\nCoax the ground beef into a rectangle shape. Cover with parchment paper. Roll the beef out into a thin rectangle. Score the rectangle into 6 individual patties. Use your slider buns as a template, but make each patty slightly larger than the bun to account for shrinkage.\nOnce all 6 patties are scored, use a metal straw to punch out 5 holes from each patty. Place the tray of meat into the freezer to firm up.\nDice 2 onions. Coat the bottom of your cast iron skillet with vegetable oil. Add your onions in an even letter on the bottom of the skillet. Pour in a little water over top to help the onions steam. Stir and sweat the onions for 2-3 minutes in the pan.\nOnce the beef patties are frozen, break them apart into individual patties.\nLay the 6 beef patties on top of the onions, leaving as little room between burgers as possible. Top each burger with a little bit of kosher salt.\nAdd the bottom bun directly onto the top of each patty (yes, before you’ve flipped it). Then place the top bun on top of the bottom bun. This will help steam the buns.\nRemove the top buns and set aside. Invert the 6 burgers onto a plate or wire-rimmed baking sheet. Top each beef patty with a slice of american cheese, then a single dill pickle chip, then the top bun. Enjoy!	whitecastlesliders
7	White Castle Sliders Babish Version	\N	6 ounces each chuck and short rib\n2 white onions, diced\nPotato slider buns\n1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded\nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper	Cut the chuck and short rib into 1-inch cubes and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze the meat and your food processor blade for 15 minutes.\nAdd the beef into a food processor and pulse for 30 seconds or until it reaches a pebbly texture.\nForm the ground beef into 1-inch meatballs.\nSaute diced onions until they’ve softened and started to brown.\nToast slider buns on a skillet.\nSprinkle cheddar cheese onto skillet to make cheese crisps.\nAdd beef balls to the skillet and season with salt and pepper.\nUsing a large spatula and dowel, smash the burgers down and then smear away with the spatula.\nTop a dollop of sauteed onions on top of each cheese crisp. Place a patty on top of each onion-cheese stack.\nStack 2 burgers onto each slider roll. Enjoy!	whitecastlesliders
8	Carbonara - Traditional	\N	1/2 pound guanciale (can substitute with pancetta)\n3 large eggs\n1 egg yolk\n4 ounces of cheese (Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano)\nGround black pepper\nKosher salt\n16 ounces spaghetti noodles\n¼ cup starchy pasta water (optional)	Start by dicing ½ pound guanciale or pancetta. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl or measuring cup, combine 3 large eggs and 1 egg yolk.\nGrate and measure out 4 ounces of cheese - I recommend Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano or a blend of the two.\nCombine grated cheese and eggs and beat together with a fork until homogenous.\nSeason the egg and cheese mixture with fresh black pepper. Do not add salt yet, because the guanciale brings a lot of salt to the dish. Beat until well incorporated.\nAdd the diced guanciale to a cold pan and then turn the heat to medium. This will allow the fat to render out slowly. Once it is fully cooked but not too crispy, turn off the heat.\nAdd your noodles to a large pot of heavily salted water. Cook until they are to your desired texture.\nAdd the cooked noodles to the pan with the guanciale. Toss to coat the noodles in the guanciale fat.\nWork quickly to add the egg and cheese mixture to the pan and mix rigorously. This will help to emulsify the sauce and make it creamy. If it’s as smooth as you’d like, you can add a little bit of pasta water (about ¼ cup). Season with salt if it needs it.\nPlate up and enjoy!	carbonara
9	Carbonara - Modern	\N	1/2 pound thick cut bacon\n4 ounces Parmesan or Romano cheese\n3 large eggs\n1 egg yolk\nGround black pepper\n2 cloves garlic\n⅓ cup starchy pasta water\n16 ounces bucatini noodles	Combine your eggs and egg yolk in a bowl.\nNext, add 4 ounces of grated cheese. Stir with a fork to combine. Season with fresh black pepper.\nSlice ½ pound of thick cut bacon into large chunks.\nAdd the sliced bacon to a cold nonstick pan and then turn the heat to medium.\nOnce the bacon is fully cooked and the fat has rendered out, strain out the grease, keeping only 2 tablespoons of fat in the pan.\nReturn the pan to medium low heat and add minced garlic. Saute for one minute and then turn off the heat.\nAdd bucatini noodles to a pot of heavily salted water and cook to desired done-ness.\nAdd the cooked noodles to the pan with the bacon along with ⅓ cup of pasta water.\nAdd the egg and cheese mixture to the pan. Toss rigorously and keep it moving.\nTaste for seasoning and assess for thickening. If it needs to be thicker, add more cheese (1 ounce at a time) and mix rigorously.\nServe and enjoy!	carbonara
10	Buttermilk Fried Chicken (Babish Style)	\N	1 whole chicken\n16 oz of buttermilk\n12 herbs and spices\n⅔ tsp salt\n½ tsp thyme\n½ tsp basil\n⅓ tsp oregano\n1 tsp celery salt\n1 tsp black pepper\n1 tsp dried mustard\n4 tsp paprika\n2 tsp garlic salt\n1 tsp ground ginger\n3 tsp white pepper\n¾ tsp MSG\n1 tsp kosher salt\n½ cup of corn starch\nCanola and Peanut oil, for frying	Break down chicken into 8 pieces. Save wing and spine pieces for making chicken stock.\nInto a large food-safe bucket, add 16 oz of buttermilk and 12 herbs and spices along with an extra tablespoon of kosher salt and chicken pieces.\nPress chicken down into the buttermilk brine and give it a good mix until they are evenly coated and keep the bucket in the fridge for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours. Take it out once or twice during its marinade time to give it good stir.\nIn a wide casserole dish, add 12 herbs and spices, 2 cups of all purpose flour and half cup of corn starch, and whisk together.\nAdd a few tablespoons of marinade to the dredge, and mix it up with your fingers or a fork until creating tiny little bits of breading that are going to stick to the chicken.\nBread all of the chicken at once and let those sit there for about 10 minutes.\nHeat canola and peanut oils to 400°F, frying for 6-9 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Dark meat should reach 175°F and white meat should register 165°F. Place on a wire rack and keep in a low temperature oven until all of the chicken has finished frying.\nOptional but you really should: Scoop up the brown, sloppy gold off the bottom of the pot and add it to the gravy.	kfcmeal
11	Chicken Stock	\N	Chicken wings and spine pieces\nVegetable oil\nOnion\nCarrots\nCelery\nFresh thyme\nHalved head of garlic\n8 cups cold water	Add chicken bones and vegetables to a large saucepan with oil. Brown all of the pieces.\nOnce the chicken has some color on it, deglaze the pot with 8 cups of cold water.\nBring the whole thing to simmer lower heat until it reaches a bare simmer, and keep it there for about 4 hours.	kfcmeal
12	Gravy for Mashed Potatoes	\N	6 tbsps butter\n⅓ cup all purpose flour\nSoy sauce\n3 cups chicken stock	In a small saucepan, melt 6 tablespoons of butter until foaming and add ⅓ cup all purpose flour, and whisk to cook for an additional minute.\nSlowly stream in 3 cups chicken stock, and whisk constantly to prevent clumping.\nAdd a good glug of soy sauce.\nSimmer for 3-4 minutes until it gets nice and thick. Taste for seasoning.	kfcmeal
13	Mashed Potatoes	\N	4 lbs russet potatoes\n1 stick unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces\n2 cups warm milk\nKosher salt\nWhite pepper	Peel 4 pounds of russet potatoes and chop into 1 inch cubes. Place into a pot of cold water.\nBring the pot to a boil. Once a boil is reached, cook for 12-16 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through.\nRinse the potatoes with hot tap water.\nPlace a few chunks of potato in a potato ricer and press them through. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Add 1 stick of unsalted butter at room temperature (cut into 1 inch pieces) 2 cups of warm milk, some kosher salt and white pepper.\nMix together.	kfcmeal
14	Buttermilk Biscuits	\N	13 ½ ounces all purpose flour\n2 Tbsp sugar\n4 tsp baking powder\n½ tsp baking soda\n½ tsp kosher salt\n2 sticks frozen butter\n1 ¼ cups buttermilk	Start by combining 13 ½ ounces all purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 4 teaspoons of baking powder, ½ teaspoon of baking soda and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt in a bowl.

17	Squid Ink Pasta	\N	For the pasta\n2 ½ cups flour\n4 large eggs\n1 Tbsp black squid ink\nFor the pasta sauce\n2 Tbsp olive oil\n2 Tbsp tomato puree\n½ shallot\n1 large clove garlic\nRed pepper flakes (optional)\n¼ cup dry white wine\n2 Tbsp black squid ink	In a stand mixer bowl, put in 2 ½ cups flour, create a well in the center, and crack in 4 large eggs along with 1 Tbsp of black squid ink. Gently beat that into the flour with a fork until a thick slurry is formed. Attach a dough hook and beat at medium to medium-low speed for 8-10 minutes. Add more flour or water as necessary until a smooth and tacky but not sticky dough is formed. Wrap in plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. If you’ve never had a wedding registry, then you probably don’t have a stand mixer, in which case you can knead the dough with your hands.\nAfter the dough has rested in plastic wrap, cut it into four equal parts, and wrap remaining three while working with the first quarter. Dust the dough liberally with flour, roll it out a bit, and pass it through the stand mixer roller on its widest setting. Laminate the dough by folding into thirds, then putting it through the roller again for 3-6 times, adding flour as necessary until the right consistency is achieved. Start rolling thinner and thinner until it is at the second to thinnest setting. Attach spaghetti cutter and roll through, lifting pasta away while gently twisting it into a loose knot to avoid tangling the pasta. Place on a rimmed baking sheet that’s covered in flour and repeat until all dough is in spaghetti strands. Cover in plastic wrap and place in fridge until it’s ready to be cooked.\nOpen can of tomato puree, finely mince half a shallot, and peel one large clove of garlic to be crushed. In a high-walled saute pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil until it is shimmering. Dump in finely minced shallot and saute for about a minute. Then add in the crushed clove of garlic and sprinkle in some red pepper flakes if you want some heat. Let those flavors get to know each other for no longer than one minute before adding ¼ cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc). Add 2 tablespoons of tomato puree and simmer until white wine has evaporated which will be 3-5 minutes.\nDuring this, cook the pasta, which will only take about 1 minute because fresh pasta cooks very quickly. While the pasta is in the boiling water for no more than 90 seconds, add 2 Tbsps of black squid ink to the pasta sauce. When pasta is done add it directly to the sauce along with a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water which will help make it more cohesive and smooth. Rigorously mix and toss pasta to make it nice and creamy. Season with kosher salt if needed. Plate and enjoy!	squidinkpasta

Cut the dough and form into balls that weigh 65 grams. For the balls, tuck the dough underneath themselves, making them smooth and round. Cover with a damp towel in between formations because the dough develops a skin very quickly. Cover the balls with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for another 20 minutes.\nRemove from fridge and gently make a hole in the middle and stretch out by circling the middle with two fingers. Once all are in bagel form, cover again with plastic wrap, and let sit out for 20 minutes before putting in the fridge overnight for at least 24 hours.\nIn a large pot, pour in about 1 ½ gallons of water, 1 Tbsp barley syrup, and 2 tsp baking soda. After that has dissolved and the water is at a boil, put in bagels and boil for 60 seconds on each side. Then, flip onto cooling rack smooth side up to drain for about one minute.

126	Bagels	\N	1 cup plus 2 tablespoons ice water (9 ounces)\n2 tablespoons malt syrup\n2 ⅔ cups (14 2/3 ounces) bread flour\n4 teaspoons vital wheat gluten\n2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast\n2 teaspoons salt\n¼ cup (1 1/4 ounces) cornmeal\n¼ cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar\n1 tablespoon baking soda	In a food processor add: 14.66 ounces of bread flour, 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten, and 2 tsp of instant yeast. Pulse to combine.\nNext combine 9 ounces of cold water and 2 Tbsp of malt syrup in a bowl. Whisk to mix. Turn food processor on low and add the cold water and malt syrup mixture. Mix for about 20 seconds, stop, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it has rested for 10 minutes, add 2 tsp of salt. Turn the food processor on medium to high for about 90 seconds.\nRemove dough from food processor and knead for about a minute. Next, divide dough into 3.5 ounce pieces. Roll the pieces into tight balls and cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes. Once they have rested, decide which method you will use to turn your balls of dough into bagels. For the best tutorial, watch the episode to see the difference in the methods.\nOption 1 - Twist Method: Roll out a piece of dough with a rolling pin until it’s roughly 5 inches across. Next, start from one end of the circle and start rolling the dough onto itself. Once it is rolled into a tight roll that is 9-10 inches long, it’s time to twist the dough. Place one hand on each side of the dough roll and then roll the ends in opposite directions to create the “twist”. Wrap the dough around your hand and then pinch the ends together. With the ring of dough still wrapped around your hand, roll the dough on your work surface to seal together.\nOption 2 - Punch Method: Take a ball of dough and place it on your work surface. Stick one finger into the center and shake the dough around your finger until a round hole forms. Pick up the dough and shape it with two fingers, coaxing it into a bagel shape. This method is easier, but doesn’t yield as great of a bagel texture as the twist method.\nPlace the bagels on a baking sheet covered in cornmeal. Cover that with plastic wrap and let sit for an hour. Once they’ve sat for an hour, place them in the fridge overnight or for 24 hours.\nBring water in a pot to a boil and add ¼ cup of sugar and 1 Tbsp of baking soda. Add the bagels to the water and boil for about 20 seconds on each side.\nRemove and place them on a wire rimmed baking sheet, making sure the cornmeal side is down. If you’d like to add toppings, now is the time to do it.\nAdd ½ cup of boiling water to the bottom of the pan and then place in the oven at 450°F for 20 to 25 minutes flipping them halfway through.\nLet cool, serve, and enjoy!	bagels

Pulse to combine.\nNext add 6 Tbsp of sliced cold butter along with 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil and mix to combine before drizzling ⅔ cup of ice cold water into the food processor while it’s processing. When a ball of dough forms, remove and immediately wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.\nRemove dough from the fridge and liberally flour your work surface. Roll out your dough as thin as possible. Using a fluted biscuit cutter, cut out cracker shapes and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet. Using a toothpick add the signature Ritz Cracker 7 holes and then brush all of them down with some melted butter. Place in a 400°F oven for 10-15 minutes.\nOnce they are golden brown in the oven, remove and brush with butter and immediately sprinkle with some salt.	aristocats

At this point, bravely pour out onto an un-floured countertop.\nGet to kneading until the dough has formed into a semi-smooth mass. Try to resist adding flour or water, if you can. If it’s too sticky, try the slap and fold method. If it’s too dry, just keep working it. Knead it until no more dry clumps of flour remain.\nFerment at room temperature for 8-24 hours. Lightly oil a nice big bowl because this will double in size. Drop the dough into the bowl, cover and let sit for 8-24 hours (my crust sat for 12 hours).\nOnce finished fermenting, oil a few proofing bowls with olive or vegetable oil.\nThen scrape your dough out onto a generously oiled countertop (make sure the countertop is oiled, or the dough will stick!). Make sure that your hands are also generously oiled or the dough will stick to your hands.\nKnead a little bit to get some of the dough out and then divide into 4 pieces for its long cold proof in the fridge.\nForm the four pieces into balls by taking the top and tucking underneath to form a nice smooth ball.\nTop each ball of dough with oil and then cover with plastic before placing into the fridge for 3 whole days.\nOnce the dough has risen, scrape out onto a generously floured countertop, flattening out into a nice circle, and rolling out via wine/whiskey bottle or roller.\nUse your knuckles, turning hand over hand, until the dough has been stretched out - leaving a little extra dough on the outside to form our crust.\nSprinkle corn flour or semolina flour down on pizza peel, then place the crust on top. This will help the pizza roll around freely, allowing us to easily slide it off the pizza steel.\nBuild the pizza by spreading tomato sauce on top, followed by a healthy layer of freshly shredded mozzarella cheese (don’t use pre-shredded mozzarella. It is coated in potato starch and will result in nasty, not even melted mozzarella cheese).\nEvenly spread out the freshly sliced olives and pineapple.\nTop with a little freshly shredded parmesan cheese to keep the toppings in place.\nPreheat the oven to 550°F for 1 hour.\nPlace the pizza peel with pizza into the oven and let the pizza cook for 8 minutes.\nEnjoy!	deadpoolpizza

You want them to freeze for about an hour.\nStart by removing bones and silver skin from your brisket, sirloin, and short rib. Slice meat into one inch strips and then cut crosswise into 1-2 inch chunks.\nPlace all the meat on a parchment lined baking sheet and put in the freezer and freeze for 15-20 minutes.\nWhile meat is freezing, prepare all of your toppings. Slice your tomatoes and onions, and chop up your lettuce. You can put any toppings you want, because it’s your burger!\nFor the special sauce, combine equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise with a good sprinkling of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika, followed by a hearty helping of sweet relish. Mix to combine.\nRemove meat and meat grinder parts from freezer. Assemble your meat grinder and start feeding your meat into the grinder. When you’ve fed all of your meat through, you should have some pebbly ground beef.\nForm into 4-5 inch pucks (or whatever size you’d like). Season with salt and pepper, and let rest in the fridge.\nButter your buns and place them on a hot skillet to toast your buns. Remove them from skillet when golden brown and set aside.\nHeat up your skillet or pan to medium high heat and add some vegetable oil. Place your burger on the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes and then flip. Once you flip, add your american cheese to the burger. Add about 1 Tbsp water to the skillet and then cover. This allows the cheese to melt and the burger to cook more evenly. When internal temperature of burger reaches your desired level of doneness, remove from skillet.\nAssemble burger to your linking. I recommend bun, lettuce, patty, onion, tomato, then bun with special sauce. Serve and enjoy!	burgers
258	Fries	\N	Russet potatoes\nPeanut oil (or preferred frying oil)\nSalt	Start by peeling your potatoes.

259	Pasta Puttanesca	\N	7 ½ ounces Semolina flour, separated\n2 ½ ounces all purpose flour\n2.3 ounces eggs (remove white as needed)\nKosher salt\n2 ounces water\n4 ounces black olives, pitted\n2 Tbsp capers\n1 can anchovies\n½ cup minced parsley\n3-4 Tbsp olive oil\n2 Tbsp butter\n1 can of whole San Marzano tomatoes\nParmesan cheese (optional)	Start by mixing 2 ½ ounces each of Semolina flour and all purpose flour with a little kosher salt and 2.3 ounces of eggs. Whisk with a fork until roughly combined. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until tacky (not sticky). Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge for 30 minutes.\nFor the semolina pasta dough, combine 5 ounces of flour with 2 ounces of water. Whisk until roughly combined. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead until tacky. Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge for 30 minutes.\nRemove pasta from fridge. Cut in half, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out your dough and then run it through on the widest setting on your pasta roller. Laminate the dough by folding into thirds and rolling out again. Do this 3 times. One notch at a time, roll your dough thinner and thinner until you get to about number 3, then put through the pasta cutter.\nPlace pasta on a flour-dusted baking sheet in a little nest. Cover in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Do this process for both pasta doughs.\nNext, pit and chop 4 ounces of olives, finely chop 2 Tbsp of capers, and 1 can of anchovies. Make sure you also have about ½ cup of minced parsley. Also lightly chop 5-7 cloves of garlic.\nSauté the garlic in 3-4 Tbsp of olive oil for about 1 minute on medium-high heat. Add 1 can of whole tomatoes, and while bringing them to a simmer, crush the tomatoes up with a spoon.\nOnce sauce is brought to a simmer, add 2 Tbsp of anchovies, ½ cup of black olives, and 2 Tbsp chopped capers.\nStir and then let simmer for 8-9 minutes. When your sauce gets to a point when you can run your spoon across the bottom and see the bottom of the pot, that’s when you kill the heat, and add the chopped parsley.\nLet the sauce cool slightly while you cook your pasta. Bring some water to a boil and cook your pasta for about 1 minute. Strain, add the noodles back to their pot, and add 2 Tbsp of butter and some black pepper for seasoning.\nPlace pasta in a bowl and add your on top sauce. Garnish with extra parsley.\nAn alternative way of doing this (Babish’s method) is to add some sauce to a sauté pan on a medium heat. Cook your pasta for about 30 seconds and then add it to separated sauce to finish cooking in the sauce. Add 1 Tbsp of butter and give the whole thing a good stir. Place in a bowl, add some extra sauce and maybe some parmesan cheese, serve and enjoy!	pastaputtanesca

Place in fridge to drain and stay cool for one hour.\nIn a food processor combine 250g of all purpose flour, 30g of sifted powdered sugar, 2 tsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, and ½ tsp of instant espresso. Pulse to combine before adding 30ml each of Marsala wine and white wine vinegar.\nOnce mixture is nice and sandy, add 2 Tbsp of butter and one whole egg, and mix for about 45 seconds or until a rough ball of dough forms.\nPlace dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for 2-5 minutes until it becomes silky and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for one hour.\nNext, take your cannoli molds and grease them up by spraying them down with Pam, or coating in vegetable oil.\nRemove dough from fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface until it’s about 1/16 of an inch thick (or just really thin). Using a 4-inch wide biscuit cutter, cut rounds out of the rolled out dough and cover them with plastic wrap (just lay plastic wrap over them on the counter).\nTake your dough round, place the cannoli mold into the center and lightly put some egg white on one side of the dough and place the egg white side over the other to seal it.\nGet your lard into a pot and heat it to 390°F, and gently place your cannolis in. Let them fry for 2-4 minutes or until golden brown, and flipping once if possible. Drain on a wire rack.\nRemove ricotta from the fridge and using a spoon or a spatula, press down on the ricotta to help drain as much moisture as you can. Then in your mixing bowl, press the ricotta through the sieve using a rubber spatula. Add 125 grams of sifted powdered sugar and ½ tsp of ground cinnamon. Attach your whisk attachment, and whisk together your cannoli cream. Place cannoli cream into a piping bag.\nNow that the pastry shells have cooled off, remove them from their molds.\nMelt some milk chocolate (or chocolate of your choice) and dip the ends of the cannoli into the chocolate and let them harden in the fridge for 15 minutes.\nRemove from the fridge and fill shells with cannoli cream. Decorate them however you like. I used chocolate chips on some and finely chopped pistachios on others. Top all with some powdered sugar. Serve and enjoy!	thegodfathercannolis

Deglaze the pan with a glug or two of dry white wine.\nSimmer over high heat until the smell of alcohol has cooked off, stirring constantly.\nNow it’s time to slowly start adding the chicken stock. You should have the chicken stock gently simmering in a different pot. Add a couple ladles at a time and stir constantly. Once you are able to drag your spoon across the bottom of the pot and it leaves a trail of exposed pot behind it, add 2 or 3 more ladles of hot chicken stock. Keep repeating this process of adding stock and stirring until you can see the bottom of the pot when scraped, all while keeping the pot at a medium simmer. Do this until the rice is almost fully cooked (toothsome).\nNext, add the butternut squash puree and stir to combine. Continue to cook over medium-low heat until the rice is complete.\nIn a separate pan, fry sage leaves in some butter until the butter starts to turn brown. Once you see the milk fats start to solidify and darken, remove the pan from the heat and pour the butter into a container to cool. Remove the fried sage leaves and set aside.\nAdd a few tablespoons of maple syrup to the risotto along with a little bit of the browned butter. Also grate in a lot of parmesan and stir until everything is melted.\nRoughly chop your reserved butternut squash flesh and add it to the pot for some texture.

Once you get all the ingredients together and the sauce is simmering, place in the oven with a cocked lid for 4 hours at 325°F.\nIn a bowl mix 3 slices of torn white bread, 2 cloves of fresh garlic, 1 small minced onion, a generous grating of parmesan, a generous grating of nutmeg, ¼ cup each of chopped basil and chopped parsley, and a pinch of dried oregano.\nMix chicken stock with 1 packet of gelatin mix and add that to the mixture as well.\nNext add 1 lb each of beef, pork, and veal, and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until everything is fully combined.\nOnce combined, shape into balls, and place on a well oiled rack on a rimmed baking sheet and bake at 400°F for 20-30 minutes or until browned.\nSlice eggplant and place on a wire baking sheet. Season with salt on both sides and let sit for 2 hours.\nRemove meatballs from the oven and place in your red sauce. Place sauce on stove and let simmer with meatballs on a low heat for about 45 minutes.\nFor the eggplant, chicken, and veal we’re going to do a simple flour, egg, bread crumb mixture. First place in the flour, then into the egg, and then into the panko bread crumbs. For the veal, I used italian seasoning bread crumbs, but you can use either.\nHeat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 350°F. First add in your eggplant. Make sure you don’t over crowd and that it’s one even layer of frying. Once brown, give them a flip, cook for another minute, let the excess oil drip off and then place on a wire rack to dry. Do the same with the chicken and veal.\nCombine butter, garlic, and herbs to make a compound butter and spread that on the inside of a hoagie roll that has been cut in half lengthwise. Place bread under broiler until just brown. Remove from the oven and top one half with either the veal, chicken, meatballs, or eggplant. Place some pieces of mozzarella on top of that and sprinkle it with parmesan and place back under the broiler until cheese is melted. Remove from the broiler and put some red sauce on top of the cheese. Cover with the other half of bread. Cut in half and enjoy!	parmhero

363	Handmade Fettuccine	\N	Flour\nSemolina flour\nEggs\nOlive oil\nRomano\nParmigiano reggiano\nGarlic\nParsley\nLemon\nSalt\nBlack pepper\nButter	Start by making a mound of flour on your countertop with a well in the middle of that you can crack two or three eggs in.\nFollowed by a little drizzle of olive oil (optional), and a pinch of salt.\nGrab a fork and beat/whisk the eggs picking up a little flour with every stroke of the fork.\nOnce it becomes too sticky grab a bench scraper and start folding everything towards the center.\nOnce a shaggy dough starts to form begin to knead the dough by hand for a solid ten minutes. Knead until sore, or when the dough has the consistency of play dough.\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for at least thirty minutes. This lets the gluten relax a little bit before rolling it out.\nAfter thirty minutes, unwrap the dough and start flouring everything - your hands, the dough, the rolling pin, the countertop, and anything else you think needs flouring around you.\nOnce finished flouring, cut the dough down the center into two halves.\nNow it’s time to start gently rolling/laminating it out. Roll like you would be using a pasta machine by rolling it out followed by folding into thirds, turn it 90 degrees and then rolling out again.  Do this 3 times total before going for the big time roll. Roll until you can almost see your hand through it.\nOnce you have the dough rolled out to size and thickness it is time to cut. Start by cutting off the edges to give you an even rectangle. From here you can make lasagna noodles, or filled pasta like tortellini or ravioli.\nFor simple pasta, loosely fold the dough cutting it into nice wide fettuccine pieces. Once finished cutting, unfold all of the pieces to make sure none of them are stuck together.\nOnce all of the noodles are unwound, lift up the noodles and toss them with a little bit of flour to make sure they don’t stick together. Make sure each individual strand is coated with floured.\nHang to dry or placed under plastic wrap until ready to use.\nEnjoy!	sauces-9w5tm-2njph

Knead until sore, or when the dough has the consistency of play dough.\nWrap the dough TIGHTLY in plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for at least thirty minutes.\nAfter thirty minutes, unwrap the dough and start flouring everything - your hands, the dough, the rolling pin, the countertop, and anything else you think needs flouring around you.\nOnce finished flouring, cut the dough down the center into two halves.\nAt least laminate the dough before running through the pasta machine.\nWith the pasta machine on its widest setting it’s time to start running it through.\nThis machine’s widest setting is a 7 and we want to get it down to a 2, so this means running it through at least 4 to 5 times.\nThis means that the dough will start to get a little long, so I recommend cutting it into two pieces and work those individually.\nOnce the dough has been rolled/thinned down to a 2, dust your dough with some flour before running through the pasta machine and making some linguini.\nMake sure that they noodles do not stick to each other after running through the blades, and then toss your noodles with some more flour to ensure no sticking.\nPlace and keep under a plastic wrap, or a ziploc bag and frozen until you are ready to use.\nEnjoy!	sauces-9w5tm-2njph

Set aside.\nOnce that’s cooked, make two smash burgers: In a large cast iron skillet, heat vegetable oil over high heat, until smoking.  Place beef balls (4 ounces of beef, divided into two balls) several inches apart in skillet, and smash down using a large, flat spatula.  Use a rolling pin or the handle of another spatula to press the burgers firmly down, until they are thin and craggly. Cook for approximately 60 seconds, until the bottom is charred and crispy.  Flip, and immediately top with cheese. Remove from heat, but leave burgers in the pan while you assemble, so the cheese melts completely.\nPlace one burger in a bun on the bottom, top with large stuffed burger, top that with some Himalayan Ketchup, and top that with the other burger.\nServe and enjoy!	ultimeatum

Pat ribs dry, remove membrane, and coat liberally with dry rub, making sure to cover every nook and cranny.  Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.\nIn a large saucepan, combine remaining ingredients, whisk to combine, and cook at a bare simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until thick and syrupy.  Can be made and refrigerated ahead of time - reheat before use.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Be sure to remove the membrane on the back of your ribs. Make a small incision and then, using a paper towel for grip, tear off of the ribs.\nSmoker Method:\nPrepare smoker according to manufacturer directions or your favorite time-honored family tradition.  Stabilize heat at 225°F - arrange ribs as desired, and smoke for 2-3 hours, or until meat is tender but still holding onto the bones.  Repeatedly baste the meat with barbecue sauce and spray with apple juice every 30 minutes.  Remove from grill, allow to rest in aluminum foil for 10 minutes before slicing, saucing, and serving.\nOven Method - Liquid Smoke:\nPrepare dry rub and barbecue sauce as described above, making substitutions as noted in the ingredients list.  Prepare ribs as usual, and preheat oven to 250°F.  Place the ribs on an aluminum foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, on a wire rack.  Combine whiskey and liquid smoke, and sprinkle evenly over ribs.  Wrap tightly in aluminum foil and bake for 2-2 1/2 hours, until tender but not falling apart.  Uncover, baste with barbecue sauce, and continue to roast for another 1 1/2 hours.  Baste with barbecue sauce every time the sauce looks sticky and loses its sheen, every 20-30 minutes.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking, increase oven temperature to 500F to create a crust on the exterior of the ribs.  Brush with sauce, slice, and serve.\nOven Method - Wok Smoke:\nPrepare ribs as described above (liquid smoke version), but omit liquid smoke.  Before sprinkling with whiskey, place ribs on a wire rack.  Line a deep wok with aluminum foil, and fill with about a cup of wood chips (hickory & oak).  Place over medium-high heat, and cook until just starting to smoke, about 5 minutes.  Place ribs on top, and cover with aluminum foil, crimping the edges tightly so no smoke escapes.  Lower heat to medium, and smoke for 10 minutes, before removing from the heat and resting for an additional 20.  Remove ribs from foil, sprinkle with plain whisky, and continue recipe as described above.	freddys-ribs-inspired-by-house-of-cards

518	Double-Glazed Apple Fritters	\N	1 ¾ cup milk (heated to 110°F)\n2 ¼  tsp active dry yeast\n¼ cup sugar\n2 Tbsp honey\n3 eggs\n22 ⅓ ounces all purpose flour\n1 ½ sticks unsalted butter (room temperature), plus an additional ½ stick\n4 large Granny Smith apples\n½ cup brown sugar\n¼ tsp cloves\n½ tsp ground ginger\n1 tsp cinnamon\n¼ tsp allspice\n1 tsp cornstarch\n1 ½ quarts vegetable oil\n2 ½ cups powdered sugar (or more, if you want an extra thick glaze)\n¼ cup milk	In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine warmed milk, active dry yeast, sugar, and honey. Whisk and let sit for 10 minutes.\nLightly beat 3 eggs and add to the stand mixer bowl along with the flour.\nCut butter into cubes and add to the stand mixer.\nUsing the dough hook, slowly beat the dough for a minute or two, then increase the speed to medium high and let it mix for 6 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl halfway through the 6 minutes.\nScrape down the sides one last time and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it rise at room temperature for one hour.\nWhile the dough is rising, prepare your apples. Peel all 4 apples and then dice into half-inch, bite sized cubes.\nToss the apple cubes in a bowl with the juice of one lemon.\nIn a large nonstick pan, melt ½ stick of unsalted butter over medium heat to lightly brown it.\nOnce you see the milk fats start to separate and change colors, add the cubed apples. Stir. Add the brown sugar and stir again.\nAdd the spices (cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and allspice) and stir to combine. Simmer, tossing occasionally, for 4-5 minutes.\nMix ¼ cup warm water with 1 tsp cornstarch. Pour the slurry into the apples to thicken up. Stir and cook for an additional minute and then set aside.\nGenerously flour your work surface. Scrape every last bit of dough out of the bowl and onto your floured counter.\nCoax the dough into a rectangle, stretching and patting it. Dump the cooled (yes, cooled) apples onto the top of the rectangle. Spread them across the dough evenly.\nFold the dough on top of itself into thirds, like a pamphlet. This laminates the dough and apples.\nCoax the dough back into a ball, making sure the apples are evenly distributed throughout. Put back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 1 hour at room temperature again.\nRe-flour your work surface and dump the dough back out. Apples will spill out but that’s okay! Liberally flour the top of the dough and then roll it out with a rolling pin to a 1-inch thickness.\nUsing a biscuit cutter, cut rounds out of the dough.\nPlace the cutout fritters onto a well floured baking sheet. Pull out the scraps and re-roll to make another round of dough.\nHeat 1 ½ quarts vegetable oil to 375°F. Pat each donut a little and stretch them before dropping into oil.\nCook for 90 seconds, then flip each donut. Cook for 90 seconds more, until golden brown and crisp. Remove and let dry on a wire rimmed baking sheet.\nDo this in batches until all of your fritters are cooked.\nTime to make the glaze! Combine a lot of powdered sugar (about 2 ½ cups) and a little bit of milk (about ¼ cup) and whisk until smooth.\nDunk each fritter into the glaze and let rest back on the rack. Once the first coat has hardened, go in and dunk each fritter again for a double glaze.\nIf you want to make a thicker glaze, double the amount of powdered sugar and use the same amount of milk for an extra thick honey bun-esque glaze.\nServe and enjoy!	applefritters

Pour your pasta into a large bowl and toss with a cup or two of your tomato sauce and mix accordingly.\nInto an aluminum pan, pour and spread about half of your pasta over the bottom of the pan.\nSpread some ricotta cheese on top of the pasta as evenly as possible and add your ½ inch chunks of mozzarella cheese on top. Then, add about 1 to 1 ½ oz of grated parmesan cheese.\nAdd the remaining half of your ziti and spread it out nice and even. Make sure none of the cheese is exposed.\nTop the pan off with a cup or two of sauce and 1 to ½ oz of grated parmesan cheese.\nCover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and place in a 350°F oven for 30 minutes.\nOnce 30 minutes has passed, take the lasagna out of the oven, uncover the pan, and place back into the oven for 15-20 minutes until browned, crispy, and bubbly on top.	ziti-lasagna
546	Babish's Baked Rigatoni	\N	1 pound rigatoni noodles\n8 ounces low moisture, full fat mozzarella cheese (½ inch chunks)\n½ pound low moisture full fat mozzarella cheese (shredded)\n16 ounces cottage cheese\n2 whole eggs\n3 ounces parmesan cheese, grated\nNutmeg, grated\nBasil, chopped\nTomato sauce (see above)\nBéchamel sauce (see below)	Boil 1 pound of ziti noodles until cooked al dente.\nIn a bowl, add 16 ounces of cottage cheese, 2 whole eggs, 2 ounces of grated parmesan cheese, and optionally, add some freshly grated nutmeg. Mix accordingly.\nAdd some chopped basil in bite-size pieces to the bowl and mix. Set aside for later.\nPour 1-2 cups of tomato sauce (method above), your pan of Béchamel sauce (see below), and your cottage cheese, egg, parmesan, and basil mixture to the pasta. Stir.\nThen, add 8 ounces of low moisture full fat mozzarella cheese (½ inch chunks) and mix until all of the ingredients are evenly dispersed.\nPour into an aluminum pan and top with 1-2 cups of tomato sauce. Top it off with ½ pound of shredded low moisture full fat mozzarella cheese and 1 oz of grated parmesan cheese.\nCover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and place in a 350°F oven for 30 minutes.\nOnce 30 minutes has passed, take the rigatoni out of the oven, uncover the pan, and place back into the oven for 15-20 minutes until browned, crispy, and bubbly around the edges.	ziti-lasagna
547	Bechamel Sauce	\N	3 Tbsp butter (melted)\n3 Tbsp flour\n2 cups milk	Into a medium saucepan, add 3 tablespoons of melted butter and 3 tablespoons of flour. Whisk together and cook for 1 minute before slowly streaming in 2 cups of milk.\nWhisk constantly and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until you end up with a thick and creamy Béchamel sauce.	ziti-lasagna
548	Pork Broth	\N	Pork bones\nPieces of short rib\n1 pig’s tail\nAromatics of choice (licorice root, cassia bark/Chinese cinnamon/cinnamon, dried tangerine peel, dried longan fruit, dried star anise pods, whole onion (quartered), fresh ginger, 2 carrots)\n4 dried Chinese scallops\n1 Daikon radish\nChinese chives/scallions	Put pork bone, short rib, and pig’s tail into a tall, narrow stock pot, then cover with cold water. Put pot on the stove and bring it to a simmer to pull impurities out of the meat. Skim the gray foamy layer of impurities off the top of the water, drain the water out, and scrub the bones and meat clean.\nPlace clean bones and meat into the empty clean stockpot, adding your choice of aromatics. I used a little handful of licorice root, a healthy-sized chunk of cassia bark (aka Chinese cinnamon or just cinnamon), a few pieces of dried tangerine peel, a handful of dried longan fruit, a handful of dried star anise pods, a whole onion quartered, a handful of fresh ginger freshly peeled, and two carrots. I also threw in 4 dried Chinese scallops, which are expensive but are a huge umami booster.\nCover with cold water and put it on the stove, bringing the pot to a bare simmer. At the beginning of the boil, skim off any scum.\nKeep it on the stove slow and low for 4-12 hours, just barely bubbling so the broth stays clear. Once flavors and colors are nice and deep, strain cool in an ice bath and refrigerate overnight.	pullednoodles
549	Hand Pulled Noodles	\N	500g bread flour\n306g water\n4g store-bought potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate mix\n5g Salt	Combine the four elements of hand-pulled noodles: 500g of bread flour, 306g of water, 5g of salt, and 4g of a mix of potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate (Note: there are countless ratios that can vary based on a number of factors such as altitude. This is the one that worked best for the video). Mix ingredients until just combined in a stand mixer. Knead for 40 minutes, ideally until dough resembles chewed gum but no need to keep going past 40 minutes if it hasn’t quite reached that consistency. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15-20 minutes.\nGently tug the dough until it’s elongated, fold it over on top of itself, and repeat. This process can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours until the dough resembles chewing gum texture. Pounding the dough against the table as you stretch also helps. Keep the dough hydrated by patting it down and brushing with water every 4-6 tugs. It should be between a very hydrated bread dough and pasta dough. Alternatively, laminate and flatten the dough until it becomes supple enough to pass through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter.\nCut the dough in half to make it easier to work with, keeping the other half covered with plastic. Stretch and give the dough a few slaps on the tabletop to prevent tearing. Give it an even roll, then evenly dust with flour to prevent sticking. It should look like a rope. Fold, stretch, and repeat until noodles form. Alternatively, stretch out each noodle one at a time, resulting in flatter and less uniform noodles. I recommend just putting the dough through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter if you are ever going to try to make these noodles at home.	pullednoodles
550	Chili Oil	\N	Szechuan peppercorns\nStar anise pods\nCassia bark\nKnob of peeled ginger\n3 lightly crushed cloves of garlic\nCanola oil (or any neutral flavored oil)\nSichuan chili	In a small saucepan, throw a handful of Szechuan peppercorns, star anise pods, cassia bark, a knob of peeled ginger, and 3 lightly crushed cloves of garlic.\nPour 2-3 cups of canola oil over the top and gently swirl over medium heat until the oil reaches about 325°F.\nStrain and pour over about a cup of Sichuan chili flakes into a heat-proof bowl. Give a little mix and set aside for about 30 minutes to cool.	pullednoodles
551	Special Ingredient Soup	\N	Water\nHand pulled noodles\nDaikon radish\nPork broth\nChinese chives or scallions\nHomemade chili oil	In a pot of water, cook noodles quickly and gently for no more than 90 seconds.\nAdd peeled and sliced Daikon radish to the broth as it is being heated up. Let simmer for about 20 minutes until soft. Check the broth for taste and add seasoning as necessary.\nScoop out the noodles with a sieve, dump into an empty bowl, and ladle broth over the top. Make sure there’s a radish slice and add a handful of Chinese chives or scallions with a dollop of chili oil on top. Enjoy!	pullednoodles
552	Tomato Sauce	\N	28-ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes\n½ white onion\nFew cloves of garlic\nPinch of crushed red pepper flake\nShake of oregano\nShake of basil\n2-3 Tbsp tomato paste\n1 Tbsp sugar\nOlive oil	Put a 28oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl and crush by hand until the tomatoes are bite-sized pieces.\nFinely chop half a white onion and smash and peel a few cloves of garlic. Into a high walled sauté plan, put a few tablespoons of olive oil and heat over medium until shimmering.\nOnce shimmering, add chopped onion and sweat for 2-3 minutes or until translucent around the edges, then add crushed garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant. When fragrant, add a pinch of crushed red pepper flake, a shake of oregano, a shake of basil, and 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste. Cook together for one minute.\nAdd the crushed tomatoes along with a tablespoon of sugar. Simmer for 20-30 minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly to prevent scorching, until the raw tomato flavor has cooked off and the sauce is thick. You know it’s thick enough when you drag a spoon through the sauce, it will part.	deepdishpizza
553	Deep Dish Pizza	\N	For the crust:\n8 ¼ ounces room-temperature water\n1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast\n1 tsp sugar\n12 ½ ounces all-purpose flour\n2 ½ ounces medium grind cornmeal\n1 ½ tsp kosher salts\n⅛ tsp cream of tartar\n⅓ cup plus 2 Tbsp vegetable oil\nFor the pizza toppings:\nMild Italian sausage, uncooked (optional)\nDeli-style sliced Provolone cheese\nDeli-style low moisture mozzarella cheese\nPre-grated parmesan	Into a stand mixer bowl, add 1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) of active dry yeast and a teaspoon of sugar to 8 ¼ ounces of room temperature water. Let bloom for 10 minutes until foamy. In a separate bowl, whisk together 12 ½ ounces of all-purpose flour, 2 ½ ounces of medium grind cornmeal, 1 ½ teaspoons of kosher salt, and ⅛ teaspoon of cream of tartar. Pour dry ingredients into yeast mixture. Then add ⅓ cup plus 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.\nUsing a dough hook, stir the mixture on low speed for 1-2 minutes until dough is off the side of the bowl. Then, put speed to medium for 7-8 minutes to knead until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too hydrated, lightly flour a cooking surface and knead by hand for an additional 1-2 minutes until consistency is soft and tacky, but not sticky.\nStretch dough into a ball and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, tossing to make sure it’s fully covered in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and sit out at room temperature for 60-90 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.\nLubricate a 12-inch cast iron skillet with vegetable oil. Grease your hands and coax the dough out of the bowl and into the pan. Push into the shape of a pizza by stretching and pushing the dough up to the sides of the pan. Let rest under cover of plastic wrap for 20-30 minutes. While this rests, you can start your tomato sauce (see recipe above).\nPress dough to sides of the pan, and it should easily hold its shape. Optional: Lay down a layer of raw mild Italian sausage into a nice even layer before the cheese.\nPlace a layer of deli-style sliced Provolone cheese on top next, then follow with a thick layer of low moisture mozzarella. More cheese = more cheese stretch!\nGenerously top cheese with tomato sauce until cheese is hidden. Then, sprinkle pre-grated parmesan on the sauce and drizzle olive oil on both the sauce and around the edge of the crust.\nPut into 425°F oven for 25-35 minutes, rotating once during baking until cooked through. Run a thin spatula around the outside edge to make sure that there’s no sticking. Slide pizza out the pan and wait at least 10 minutes before cutting and serving pizza. Enjoy!	deepdishpizza
554	Naan	\N	5 cups all purpose flour\n1 tsp active dry yeast\n1/2 tbsp sugar\n2 tsp sugar\n1 tsp salt\n1 cup water\nVegetable oil\nGhee	To a mixing bowl, add 5 cups of all purpose flour, 1 tsp of sugar, and 1 tsp of salt.\nIn a separate small bowl, combine 3 tbsp of warm water, 1 tsp of active dry yeast, and 1 tsp of sugar. Let sit for a few minutes to activate the yeast.\nOnce the top of the yeast mixture starts to form small bubbles, add the yeast mixture to the mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of water (and more as needed if the dough is too dry) to the bowl and mix together with hands. Kneed until the dough is smooth, tacky, loose, and easy to work with.\nPlace dough back into the bowl and thoroughly coat with canola oil. Cover the bowl of dough with plastic wrap and let sit for about an hour or until the dough is about twice its original size. Then, put in the fridge either boiled or as is for at least an hour or until the next day.\nDivide the dough into equal parts. Roll each part into a ball and place onto a baking sheet that is dusted with flour. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or up to 2 days.\nRoll out the naan and place into a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven for about 5 minutes until it is risen and puffy. Lightly brush with ghee and enjoy!	indianbreads
555	Lachha Paratha	\N	Whole wheat flour\nSalt\nOil or ghee\nWater	Add water to a heap of flour, kneading and adding more water until dough reaches a hydrated, smooth consistency. To further soften the dough, add a tablespoon of oil or ghee.\nPour a little bit of oil in a bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for about 30 minutes.\nDivide dough into balls that are slightly larger than a golf ball and place onto a baking sheet that is dusted with flour.\nRoll out the dough and work with it until it is further expanded. The thinner the dough, the more layers for the lachha.\nBrush the dough with ghee, dust it with a little bit of flour, and fold the dough in a form that is similar to an accordion.\nSlap the folded dough on the counter to stretch it out, then roll each section up in pinwheel form. Make sure to tuck the ends of the dough under the surface. Let the dough rest.\nOnce the dough is rested, flatten the dough out as thin as possible and place in a pan over the stove until browned with a light and flaky texture. Enjoy!	indianbreads
556	Roti	\N	Whole wheat flour\nSalt\nOil or ghee\nWater	Add water to a heap of flour. Knead and add more water until dough reaches a hydrated, smooth consistency. To further soften the dough, add a tablespoon of oil or ghee.\nPour a little bit of oil into a bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap for about 30 minutes.\nDivide dough into balls that are slightly larger than a golf ball and place onto a baking sheet that is dusted with flour. Let the dough rest.\nThinly roll out the dough and place over an open stove. Remove once lightly browned and puffy. Brush with ghee, dust with a little bit of salt, and enjoy!	indianbreads
557	Basic Boozy Shake	\N	12 ounces ice cream\n6 ounces milk\nBourbon of choice\nCherry (for garnish)\nWhipped cream (for garnish)\nChocolate shavings (for garnish)	Combine 12 ounces ice cream, a shot of bourbon, and 6 ounces milk in a blender. Blend until desired consistency. Top with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and a cherry.	mostexpensiveshake
558	Most Expensive Shake	\N	1 ½ cups high-quality milk\n1 ½ cups high-quality heavy cream\n6 Tbsp sugar\n1/3 cup corn syrup\nTahitian vanilla beans\nKosher salt\n6 local cage-free eggs\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n12 ounces high-quality, high butterfat milk\n3 ounces Devonshire clotted cream\nMadagascar vanilla beans\nEdible gold leaf\nLouis XIII Cognac (or other high-quality spirit)\nDonkey caramel sauce (for garnish)\nChocolate shavings (for garnish)	Combine 1 ½ cups each of the best milk and heavy cream that can be found in a large saucepan. Add 6 tablespoons of sugar and 1/3 cup corn syrup. Split Tahitian vanilla beans down the side with a paring knife and use the back of the knife (or a small spoon) to scrape out the beans. Deposit both the beans and the casing into the milk and cream mixture. Add a pinch of kosher salt. Put the saucepan on medium-low heat until it reaches 175°F.\nSeparate the yolks from 6 cage-free eggs and place them into a medium bowl with a moist paper towel underneath the bowl. Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar and whisk until combined. Remove cream mixture from the saucepan on the stove. Whisking constantly, slowly ladle in one full ladle of the hot mixture into the eggs to temper them. Then, dump egg mixture into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly until thickened and at 185°F. Be sure not to rush over too high of a flame or there will be little dots in the custard and scrambling on the bottom of the pan. Once it reaches temperature, pour immediately into a heatproof bowl and let the bowl sit for 15-20 minutes until it stops steaming. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the custard. Place into the fridge for 4-24 hours.\nOnce the custard is chilled, dig out pieces of the vanilla pod, and churn custard using method of choice. The custard should be 21°F, which can take 15-30 minutes depending on the device. Start taking its temperature when the mixture starts to resemble soft serve. Dump into a pre-frozen metal container, such as a loaf pan, and spread out evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the freezer for at least 4 hours.\nAdd 12 ounces of high-quality high butterfat milk and 3 ounces of Devonshire clotted cream to a blender. Dig out Madagascar vanilla beans from pods and add to blender. Scoop out approximately 18 ounces of the homemade Tahitian vanilla ice cream and top with edible gold leaf before dumping into the blender. Very gently pour in the bare minimum amount of Louis XIII (or other high-quality spirit). Blend for about 30 seconds until completely smooth and studded with bits of gold. Pour into a milkshake glass. Top with whipped cream, edible gold, a maraschino cherry, and donkey caramel sauce.	mostexpensiveshake
559	Espresso Romano		Lemon\nEspresso\nSugar	Take your pre-made shot of espresso served with a little squeeze of lemon and a lemon wedge. This significantly increases the acidity of the coffee, so add a ½ tsp of sugar if needed.	espressodrinks
560	Americano		Espresso (double shot)\nHot water	This is an approximation of American-style drip coffee by adding hot water to a double shot of espresso.	espressodrinks
561	Cappuccino		Espresso (double shot)\nSteamed milk\nFoam (large layer)	This is a double shot of espresso and equal parts steamed milk and very frothy foam. Pour from up high to allow the steamed milk to mix with the coffee and then move closer while you get to the foam, which allows it to settle on top. The foam should be thick and form a clearly defined layer on top of the coffee.	espressodrinks
562	Latte		Espresso\nSteamed milk\nFoam (small layer)	Similar to the cappuccino, pour from up high to allow the steamed milk to mix with the coffee and then move closer while you get to the foam, which allows it to settle on top. The foam should be very light and creamy and not too bubbly and frothy. There is a much less defined layer than with the cappuccino.	espressodrinks
563	Mocha		Espresso (double shot)\nSteamed milk\nChocolate sauce	Start with a double shot of espresso and add to it an equal amount of chocolate sauce. This is a similar deal to the latte with a whole lot of steamed milk and a little bit of foam. Top the drink off with some whipped cream, cocoa powder, chocolate drizzle, a cinnamon stick if desired.	espressodrinks
564	Cortado		Espresso\nSteamed milk\nDollop of foam	This is a single shot of espresso to which you will add an equal amount or more of steamed milk and topped with a little dollop of foam.	espressodrinks
565	Macchiato		Espresso (double shot)\nFoam	This is a double shot of espresso with a big dot of foam on top.	espressodrinks
566	Affogato		Espresso (double shot)\nVanilla ice cream	Take a single scoop or a few scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with a double shot of espresso.	espressodrinks
567	Espresso - Moka Pot		Espresso beans\nWater	Unscrew the top chamber of the mocha pot and remove the brewing basket. Fill the basket to the top without pressing it down with a medium to fine grind of coffee.\nFill the chamber below with hot water up to the valve and replace the filter basket over the top. Screw the brewing chamber on and you are ready to make some espresso.\nPlace the mocha pot directly on a stovetop or induction burner on medium to high heat. In 1-2 minutes the pressure and heat should build up in the chamber below and press its way up through the coffee, which will brew a single shot of espresso.\nWhile it does not have the distinctive crema floating over the coffee, the mocha pot is the least expensive and most accessible way to make a cup of espresso at home.	espressodrinks
568	Espresso - AeroPress		Espresso beans\nWater	The brewing ratio should be 20g of finely ground coffee and 55g of nearly boiling water at about 205 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAgain, there is no distinctive layer of crema floating over the coffee, but it is a decent shot of espresso.	espressodrinks
569	Espresso - The Flair		Espresso beans\nWater	This method uses a great illustration of how espresso is made with heat and pressure. In addition, it is a great example of how important grind size is and why you cannot use a blade grinder instead of a conical bur.\nThe grinds need to be consistent and a very specific size. If the grind is too coarse, all the extra space between the grinds lets the water pass through too quickly, which will leave you with a semi-strong cup of coffee instead of espresso.\nGrind the coffee a little finer, but not too fine. If there is too little space between the grinds makes it almost impossible to press the coffee through and you’ll most likely break your machine before pulling a single decent shot. It will have the crema you are looking for, but not quite enough coffee.\nThis will be a matter of trial and error until you find the sweet spot. For Babish’s favorite method, take 16g of coffee that is ground between levels one and 1 and 2 on your grinder and tamped with about 20lbs of force.\nFill up the cylinder with 60mL of 200 degree Fahrenheit water and extract with about 35lbs of force.\nFor knowing how much pressure you are putting on the machine, you can use a bathroom scale. Press down on it without putting your entire body weight on it and the extraction should take about 35 seconds.\nA good espresso shot will separate into three parts with a thick creamy crema on top, a  mysterious dark orange body below that that slowly disappears into the crema, and finally, the deep chocolate-y brown coffee underneath it all.	espressodrinks
570	Frothed Milk - Automatic Milk Frother		Milk	Add milk, hit the button, and in a few minutes, you will have some nice and hot foamy milk.\nThe machine produces a lot of foam and not that much steamed milk. This is great for some drinks like cappuccinos, but not great for others.	espressodrinks
572	Frothed Milk - French Press		Milk	Heat up the milk to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and pour directly into your french press. Froth the milk using the metal filter by jamming it up and down a few times. This will produce steamed milk and foam that much more closely resembles what you would get with a steam wand than most other at home solutions.\nSwirl the milk, tap it on the counter, and let it rest for about 30 seconds. This will get rid of any larger bubbles and makes the foam nice and glossy.	espressodrinks
573	Crêpes		2 large eggs\n½ cup water\n¾ cup milk\n3 Tbsp melted butter\nSalt\n1 cup flour	In a blender, combine 2 large eggs, ½ cup of water. ¾ cup of milk, 3 Tbsp of melted butter, a pinch of salt, and 1 cup of flour.\nPulse the mixture 10-12 times on low power until combined and then scrape down the sides for any loose bits of flour. Pulse a couple more times until you have a thin pancake batter. Let the mixture sit in the refrigerator for one hour to get rid of any bubbles.\nUsing a non-stick skillet or a crêpe maker that is coated with butter, pour your batter in and slowly rotate the pan until the entire surface is covered with batter and it is nice and thin.\nLet cook for 30-60 seconds over medium high heat until it is dappled brown. Flip the crêpe and let cook for an additional 15-30 seconds until it is cooked through.	crepessuzette
574	Buckwheat Crêpes		2 large eggs\n½ cup water\n¾ cup milk\n3 Tbsp melted butter\nSalt\n1 cup buckwheat flour	In a blender, combine 2 large eggs, ½ cup of water. ¾ cup of milk, 3 Tbsp of melted butter, a pinch of salt, and 1 cup of buckwheat flour.\nPulse the mixture 10-12 times on low power until combined and then scrape down the sides for any loose bits of flour. Pulse a couple more times until you have a thin pancake batter. Let the mixture sit in the refrigerator for one hour to get rid of any bubbles.\nUsing a non-stick skillet or a crêpe maker that is coated with butter, pour your batter in and slowly rotate the pan until the entire surface is covered with batter and it is nice and thin.\nLet cook for 30-60 seconds over medium high heat until it is dappled brown. Flip the crêpe and let cook for an additional 15-30 seconds until it is cooked through.	crepessuzette
575	Breakfast Crêpes		1 egg\nSwiss cheese, grated\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper\nFreshly minced chives\nHomemade chili oil (ingredients below)	For making the actual crêpes, follow either the classic crêpe recipe or the buckwheat crêpe recipe, which are both listed above.\nOnce you flip the crêpe, add a generous grating of swiss cheese to the top of the crêpe.\nCoat a pan with butter and fry one egg sunny-side up. Once the egg is fried, add it on top center of the crêpe.\nFold four edges up around the center to make a square. Season with kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and freshly minced chives.\nIf desired, add some homemade chili oil (recipe listed below) to top everything off.	crepessuzette
576	Chili Oil		Szechuan peppercorns\nStar anise pods\nCassia bark\nKnob of peeled ginger\n3 lightly crushed cloves of garlic\nCanola oil (or any neutral flavored oil)\nSichuan chili	In a small saucepan, throw a handful of Szechuan peppercorns, star anise pods, cassia bark, a knob of peeled ginger, and 3 lightly crushed cloves of garlic.\nPour 2-3 cups of canola oil over the top and gently swirl over medium heat until the oil reaches about 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Strain and pour over about a cup of Sichuan chili flakes into a heat-proof bowl. Give a little mix and set aside for about 30 minutes to cool.	crepessuzette
577	Mushroom and Gruyere Crêpes		5-6 oz mushrooms\n¼ small Spanish onion, diced\n1 single garlic clove\n1 Tbsp butter\nDry sherry or cognac\nGruyere cheese\nFreshly picked thyme	Finely chop up ¼ of a small Spanish onion as well as 1 single clove of garlic.\nOn the stovetop, coat a pan with 1 tablespoon of butter and let melt over medium heat. Then, add the onion and mushrooms and let them sauté for 5-7 minutes. Toss occasionally and add salt to draw any excess moisture out of the mushrooms and cook until brown and soft.\nAdd the garlic and sauté for an additional 30 seconds. Season with freshly ground pepper and optionally flambe with a bit of dry sherry or cognac.\nFor making the actual crêpes, follow either the classic crêpe recipe or the buckwheat crêpe recipe, which are both listed above.\nTop off your crêpe with a generous amount of grated Gruyere cheese as well as your mushroom mixture. Fold the crêpe and roll it up like a flat wide open-ended burrito.\nGrate a little bit of extra cheese on top and garnish with freshly picked thyme.	crepessuzette
578	Nutella and Strawberry Crêpes		Strawberries\nNutella\nWhipped cream\nChocolate syrup	For making the actual crêpes, follow either the classic crêpe recipe or the buckwheat crêpe recipe, which are both listed above.\nSlice up some fresh strawberries and set aside for later. To the top of your crêpe, add a generous dollop of Nutella and evenly spread it out to the edges.\nAdd the strawberries to the top of the crêpe. Fold the crêpe in half like a quesadilla and then fold in half one more time. Add some whipped cream and chocolate syrup to top everything off.	crepessuzette
579	Crêpes Suzette		3 Tbsp butter\nSugar\n1 orange\nDry sherry or cognac\nVanilla ice cream	For making the actual crêpes, follow either the classic crêpe recipe or the buckwheat crêpe recipe, which are both listed above.\nMelt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large sauté pan and add at least 2 tablespoons of sugar. Then, add the zest and juice from any type of orange of your choice.\nBring the mixture to a simmer and gently swirl to incorporate all of the sugar.\nBegin dunking your pre-prepared crêpes into the liquid and make sure that it is nicely coated on both sides of the bottom half of the crêpe.\nLay the crêpe down in the liquid and fold it in half double quesadilla style.\nRinse and repeat with two additional crêpes and arrange them into a quadrant. Cook for about one minute on the first side before flipping to make sure that they are nice and evenly coated.\nLet the crêpes sit in the pan for 3-5 minutes over medium heat until they are nice and caramelized on one side. Arrange the crêpes on a plate.\nFlambe over the stovetop with either dry sherry or cognac.\nGently pour over the crêpes or add one scoop of vanilla ice cream to top everything off.	crepessuzette
580	Pie Crust - Standard		10 ounces all-purpose flour\n1 tsp kosher salt\n2 sticks unsalted butter, frozen\nIce water	Combine 10 ounces of all-purpose flour with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and dump it into a food processor using the blade attachment. Pulse a few times to combine.\nUsing the grating attachment and allowing it to spin, press two sticks of thoroughly frozen unsalted butter through the feed tube and into the flour mixture. Add mixture to a bowl. Toss to make sure that all of the butter is coated in flour.\nSlowly begin to add 1 tablespoon of ice water at a time to the mixture. The amount will depend on many different factors, so continue adding the ice water slowly and mixing the dough together until it just starts to hold its shape. It took about 15 tablespoons for me.\nTurn the dough out onto a flat, floured work surface and gently knead it into one cohesive mass. Don’t worry if the dough looks a little dry and crumbly because it will continue to hydrate once it is placed in the fridge.\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and pat it out into a thick round disc so that the dough is easier to roll out later. Place the dough into the fridge and let sit for at least 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes has passed, the dough should be nice and firm and should look like it has hydrated nicely. In addition, it should be visibly dappled with little bits of butter. Take half of the dough, wrap with plastic, and place it back into the fridge for later.\nOn a flat work surface that is covered with flour, and adding flour as needed, roll the dough out to a diameter that is one to two inches wider than the pie plate you intend to use.\nOnce the dough is rolled out to your desired specifications, use your rolling pin to lift it up over countertop and transfer it over to your pie plate.\nInstead of pressing the pie dough into the corners, lift and drop it into the corners to avoid stretching the pie dough. Make sure that the dough is generously hanging over the sides of the plate. Trim off any excess dough on the edge of the pie plate and and wrap up the excess dough for later.\n“Flute” the edge of the pie crust by placing your finger and thumb on the crust and and pressing the dough up between them repeating around the circumference of the crust until you have achieved a pattern. Let sit in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.\nOnce 30 minutes has passed, line the pie dough with aluminum foil and fill it with the pie weight of your choice, such as rice or dry beans. Place in a 400°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly brown. Remove the foil and “dock” the crust by poking several little holes in the bottom of the crust using a fork. Place back into the oven for another 7 to 9 minutes until a little more golden brown.	pies
581	Pie Crust - Double		10 ounces all-purpose flour\n1 tsp kosher salt\n2 sticks unsalted butter, frozen\nIce water\n1 beaten egg white\nGranulated sugar	Combine 10 ounces of all-purpose flour with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and dump it into a food processor using the blade attachment. Pulse a few times to combine.\nUsing the grating attachment and allowing it to spin, press two sticks of thoroughly frozen unsalted butter through the feed tube and into the flour mixture. Remove from processor and add mixture to a bowl. Toss to make sure that all of the butter is coated in flour.\nSlowly begin to add 1 tablespoon of ice water at a time to the mixture. The amount will depend on many different factors, so continue adding the ice water slowly and mixing the dough together until it just starts to hold its shape. It took about 16 tablespoons for me.\nTurn the dough out onto a flat work surface and gently knead it into one cohesive mass. Don’t worry if the dough looks a little dry and crumbly because it will continue to hydrate once it is placed in the fridge. Take a knife and divide the dough into two slices.\nWrap the dough in plastic and pat it out into a thick round disc so that the dough is easier to roll out later. Place the dough into the fridge and let sit for at least 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes has passed, the dough should be nice and firm and should look like it has hydrated nicely. In addition, it should be visibly dappled with little bits of butter. Take half of the dough, wrap with plastic, and place it back into the fridge for later.\nOn a flat work surface that is covered with flour, and adding flour as needed, roll the dough out to a diameter that is one to two inches wider than the pie plate you intend to use.\nOnce the dough is rolled out to your desired specifications, use your rolling pin to lift it up over countertop and transfer it over to your pie plate.\nInstead of pressing the pie dough into the corners, lift and drop it into the corners to avoid stretching the pie dough. Make sure that the dough is generously hanging over the sides of the plate. Place it into the fridge and let sit for 30 minutes.\nOnce 30 minutes has passed, line the pie dough with aluminum foil and fill it with the pie weight of your choice, such as rice. Place in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly brown. Remove the foil and “dock” the crust by poking several little holes in the bottom of the crust using a fork. Place back into the oven for another 7 to 9 minutes until a little more golden brown.\nAfter the crust is removed from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before using a fork to poke and deflate any puff ups. Trim off the excess pie dough around the circumference.\nTo make the additional layer of crust, roll out the other half of your dough to the same thinness and cover the filling making sure that it is evenly distributed. Trim off any excess dough and tuck it in gently underneath the par baked crust.\nCut a couple of vents in the top of the dough and brush the entire thing down with a beaten egg white and sprinkle with a few pinches of granulated sugar.\nPlace into a 425°F oven for 35 to 50 minutes. Let it cool for at least 4 hours.	pies

In addition, it should be visibly dappled with little bits of butter. Take half of the dough, wrap with plastic, and place it back into the fridge for later.\nOn a flat work surface that is covered with flour, and adding flour as needed, roll the dough out into a large rectangle and cut into 10 equally sized strips and add it to an additional pie crust that has been refrigerated and not baked just yet.\nAdd your mixture to the crust and then lay 5 of your strips evenly and parallel to one another across the top of the pie. 1 in the center, 2 each to the right, and 2 each to the left.\nLift up 2 of the strips and snake another strip in underneath them perpendicular. Then, lay those 2 strips back down on top of the new strip and repeat the process with the 3 strips that you didn’t pull back during the last round.\nTrim the edges, tuck them underneath the bottom crust nice and tight, and brush the surface down with 1 beaten egg white and a few sprinkles of granulated sugar. Place in a 400°F oven for 30 to 45 minutes until deeply golden brown. Let cool completely before digging in.	pies

600	Cauliflower Pizza		Cauliflower\n2 eggs\n2 ounces low-moisture hand-shredded mozzarella cheese\n1 ounce finely grated parmesan cheese\n1 14½ ounce can of chopped tomatoes\nDry basil\nDry oregano\nRed pepper flakes\n1 clove garlic\n1-2 Tbsp  chopped onion\nKosher salt\nPepperoni\nFresh basil	Peel off all of the green parts from the top of the cauliflower and slice it in half. To remove the core, take a knife and cut around the top, bottom, and sides of the core and peel it right out. Set aside the core to cook separately later.\nSeparate the cauliflower into individual florets by cutting it into thick pieces. This will make it easier to trim out the stems of the cauliflower. Then, separate the florets by breaking them up by hand until you end up with bite-sized pieces. Set aside the stems to cook separately with the core later.\nBlend the cauliflower florets and ensure that every individual piece is being chopped up in between pulses. Blend until you end up with a fine porridge-like texture that is not too smooth.\nTo get the most possible moisture out of the cauliflower, cook it in a shallow wide sauté pan until it is soft and dry. Dump the cooked cauliflower out onto some paper towels and spread it out until it is flat and allow as much steam to escape as possible. Allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\nOnce the cauliflower is cool, continue to get the moisture out firmly pressing the surface with paper towels. After placing the crust into a large mixing bowl, add 2 eggs, 2 ounces of low-moisture hand-shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1 ounce of finely grated parmesan. Mix to combine.\nDump the crust onto a parchment lined baking sheet and form it into two rough individual pizzas. Par bake in a 400°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they are golden brown.\nFor the pizza sauce, use a blender to combine, 1 14 ½ ounce can of chopped tomatoes, a few sprinkles each of dry basil and dry oregano, 1 clove of garlic, 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped onion, and a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Gently and quickly pulse a few times until the sauce is slightly smooth but still chunky.\nFor seasoning, add kosher salt along with any other spices or seasonings of your choice. Pulse to fully combine.\nTop the cauliflower crust off with a thin and even layer of your pizza sauce and a healthy portion of grated mozzarella cheese and an optional portion of pepperoni. Place the pizzas back into the oven for another 8 to 12 minutes. Add fresh parmesan and basil if desired.\nAllow the pizzas to cool off for 5 to 10 minutes before attempting to remove them from the parchment paper. Slice the pizza as desired and enjoy.	healthymeals2
601	Cauliflower Fried Rice		Cauliflower\nVegetable oil\n1 egg\n6 ounces sliced shiitake mushrooms\nChopped ham\nFrozen edamame\n1 crushed clove of garlic\n3 Tbsp soy sauce\n3 Tbsp oyster sauce\n3 Tbsp sesame oil\nSesame seeds\nScallions	Use a cheese grater to dismantle your head of cauliflower into tiny granules until you end up with a consistency that is similar to rice.\nIn a large non-stick pan that is coated with vegetable oil, scramble 1 egg and set it aside for later. Wipe down the pan and use the same pan to heat up another small amount of vegetable oil for sautéing.\nSauté 6 ounces of sliced shiitake mushrooms and let them brown up for 3 to 4 minutes before adding chopped ham and frozen edamame. Sauté for an additional 2 to 3 minutes until cooked and heated through. Then, add 1 crushed clove of garlic and sauté for one additional minute.\nFinally, add your cauliflower rice to the pan and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes before adding 3 tablespoons each of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Sauté and cook everything together for another 1 to 2 minutes and add your scrambled egg to the pan and chop it up for even distribution. Top everything off with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds.\nGarnish your rice with some thinly sliced scallions and one last sprinkling of sesame seeds.	healthymeals2
602	Cauliflower Macaroni & Cheese		Cauliflower\n1½ cups water\n4 Tbsp (½ stick) of unsalted butter\nPanko breadcrumbs\n½ small onion, roughly chopped\nFresh thyme leaves\n1 garlic clove, chopped\n1-1 ½ tsp dijon mustard\nGround white pepper\nCayenne pepper\n2 ounces grated parmesan cheese\n5 ounces shredded yellow cheddar cheese\nKosher salt	Separate the head and the cauliflower florets and finely chop them up before placing each pile into individual bowls. Set aside the core as well as the stem pieces for later.\nIn a dutch oven, add 1 ½ cups of water, the cauliflower core pieces and stems, and 4 tablespoons (½ stick) of unsalted butter. Cover and bring to a simmer before adding in a steamer basket as well as the cauliflower florets. Cover and steam for about 10 minutes.\nIn one sauté pan, toast up some panko breadcrumbs and butter. In another sauté pan, add ½ of a small roughly chopped onion. Sauté each pan for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs are toasted and golden brown. Add a few freshly picked thyme leaves to the breadcrumbs and set aside to cool. Add 1 chopped garlic clove to the roughly chopped onion during their last minute of cooking.\nOnce 10 to 12 minutes has passed, the florets should be easy to pierce with a knife. Set aside the florets for later and add the onion and garlic mixture to the cauliflower stems and cores. Cover and let it sit for another 10 minutes until the cauliflower stems and cores are soft and easy to puree.\nAfter 10 minutes, add the mixture to a blender along with 1 to 1½ teaspoons of dijon mustard, a generous sprinkling of ground white pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper, 1 ounce of grated parmesan cheese, and 3 ounces of shredded yellow cheddar cheese.\nBlend on high-speed until you end up with a smooth puree. Season with kosher salt as necessary and add it to the steamed cauliflower florets. Dump everything into a baking vessel of your choice and smooth it out evenly. Top it off with 2 more ounces of shredded yellow cheddar cheese as well as some more of the panko breadcrumbs that are tossed in 1 additional ounce of parmesan cheese.\nPlace into a 400°F oven for 15 minutes.	healthymeals2
603	Calzone Dough		360 ml tepid water\n1 tsp dry yeast\n½ tsp plain white sugar\n600g bread flour\n1 tsp kosher salt\nCoarsely ground cornmeal	In a maxed-out oven, preheat two pizza stones or one pizza stone and one pizza steel at 550°F for one hour.\nInto the bowl of a stand mixer, add 360 ml of tepid water, 1 teaspoon of dry yeast, and ½ teaspoon of plain white sugar. Let it bloom for 10 minutes before adding 600 grams of bread flour to give the dough a hydration of about 60%. Next, add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and knead on medium speed for about 5 minutes.\nPre-divide the dough into your desired portions. Since we are making calzones, make sure that you are using a double portion of dough. Then, stretch each divided portion into a taut ball. The rounder and more taut the ball is, the easier everything will be later on. Place each portion of dough into individual well-oiled bowls, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 days.\nFor cold fermented pizza dough, allow your pre-made dough to proof at room temperature for two hours. Start by generously flouring the dough as well as your work surface.\nRoll out the two ends of the dough and leave a sort of mound of unrolled dough in the middle, which you can then rotate and roll from the center. Pass the dough repeatedly over your knuckles until gravity stretches it out to about a 10-inch round.\nPrep your pizza peel by dusting it with a bit of coarsely ground cornmeal, which is going to allow the pizza to slide off into the oven with ease. Take care of any final shaping and stretching.	seinfeldcalzone-z38zn
604	Calzone Sauce		1 28-ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes\n½ small onion, chopped\n2 cloves garlic\nDried oregano\nDried basil\nCrushed red pepper flake (Optional)\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper	Into a blender, add one 28 ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes, ½ of a small chopped onion, 2 cloves of garlic, a few sprinkles each of dried oregano, dried basil, and crushed red pepper flake. Hit the mixture with one second pulses until it is relatively smooth. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.\nIn a saucepan, add your pizza sauce as well as a little splash of water to prevent the sauce from getting too thick. On a stovetop, cook the sauce for about 30 minutes. Set aside for later.	seinfeldcalzone-z38zn
605	Calzone		Fresh mozzarella cheese (thinly sliced)\nEggplant\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper\nOlive oil\nRicotta cheese\nPepperoni\nCoarsely ground cornmeal\nFull fat low moisture mozzarella cheese (shredded)	Slice an eggplant and place the slices on a rack set and rimmed baking sheet and season both sides with some light sprinklings of kosher salt.\nAfter about 30 minutes, you will begin to notice that a brown liquid has materialized on top of the eggplant slices. Use a paper towel to dab the liquid off of both sides of the eggplant slices.\nLine a sheet pan with aluminum foil and place the rack of eggplant slices on top. Season the slices with a little bit of freshly ground black pepper and a few healthy glugs of olive oil for flavor and coloring. Place in a 400°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until the slices are nicely browned and soft. Set aside to cool off.\nOnce the eggplant slices are cooled off, chop them into smaller pieces.\nTo your cold fermented dough, add a generous amount of ricotta cheese and spread it out. Make sure to leave a 2 to 3 inch gap on the outside. Then, add some pepperonis as well as your chopped roasted eggplant slices. To top everything off, add some thinly sliced mozzarella cheese.\nFold the dough over while trying to drape instead of stretch. Seal the dough shut and use a pizza cutter to trim off the excess dough. Pinch the edge shut to make sure that it is completely sealed and tuck in the calzone tips to make sure it will fit on the pizza peel.\nDust the pizza peel with ground cornmeal and place the calzone on top and make any last minute adjustments. Make sure that the thicker part of the calzone is facing the hotter part of the oven.\nPlace into the oven (after it has been maxed out and preheating for one hour) between the two pizza stones for 5 to 15 minutes. Once it is finished, immediately slice the calzone in half to prevent the steam from making the crust soggy from the inside out.\nTo reduce the moisture inside of your calzone, line a sieve with four layers of cheesecloth and set into a bowl. Dump in your ricotta cheese, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and drain overnight. Alternatively, you could weigh everything down with something heavy and let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Use shredded full fat low moisture mozzarella cheese, layer the other toppings, and fold using the same method as before. Place into the oven (after it has been maxed out and preheating for one hour) between the two pizza stones for 5 to 15 minutes. Once it is finished, immediately slice the calzone in half to prevent the steam from making the crust soggy from the inside out.	seinfeldcalzone-z38zn

Drizzle the trimmings with a bit of vegetable oil and place into a 450°F oven for 30 to 45 minutes until the trimmings are deeply golden brown.\nPlace the trimmings into a tall and narrow stockpot. The more narrow the pot, the less evaporation there will be and the longer you can allow it to simmer without having to top off with extra water. To the pot, add some chopped celery, chopped carrots, one whole head of garlic that is chopped in half, one whole onion that is quartered, a few sprigs each of fresh rosemary and fresh thyme, a little handful of parsley, a few whole black peppercorns, and two bay leaves.\nBring it to a bare simmer, partially cover the pot, and allow to simmer anywhere from 4 to 24 hours. You may use an induction burner if you do not want to keep the stove on all night.	turturkeykey
607	Turturkeykey		1 Tbsp sage\n½ tsp thyme, finely minced\n1 tsp rosemary, finely minced\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper\nFreshly grated nutmeg\nFreshly grated garlic\nOlive oil\nWhole turkey	Begin by not only de-boning the turkey, but removing the meat and trying to keep as much of the skin as intact as possible. This will ease the process of making a turkey roulade, which will allow us to stuff the turkey with even more turkey. Follow the video if you want to try to do this!\nTaking the dark meat, trim off the gristle and fat from the thigh as well as the drumstick. Cut into 1-inch cubes and place on a parchment lined baking sheet or plate to be chilled in the freezer for 15 to 25 minutes until just starting to turn firm around the edges. Put your food processor blade in the freezer as well. This will make the meat a whole lot easier to grind.\nPlace the blade and the dark meat into the food processor and pulse repeatedly until you end up with a nice and finely textured dark meat ground turkey sausage mixture. Dump the meat out into a bowl.\nFor flavor, add some finely chopped fresh herbs including a packed tablespoon of sage, ½ a teaspoon of finely minced thyme, and a teaspoon of finely minced rosemary. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and then add a little bit of freshly grated nutmeg and a clove or two of freshly grated garlic. Mix together with your hands until all of the herbs and spices are evenly distributed.\nTaking the breast, remove the tender from the bottom and trim off any fat or gristle. “Butterfly” the breast so that it is nice and thin for the roulade. Cover with plastic wrap and pound it with either a meat mallet or a frying pan until it is completely flat. For the resemblance of a rectangle, trim and “butterfly” the tender and use it to patch the corner of the breast.\nEvenly spread the turkey sausage mixture over the top of the flat tender, pat it down, and begin rolling it up starting with the side that has been patched so that it all stays together.\nFlatten out the skin until it is as flat and stretched as possible. Place the roulade in the very center with the seam facing upward. Wrap it in the skin, trim off any excess, and begin to tie. Tie it every 1 to 2 inches and make sure to tie it tighter towards the thicker part of the breast for a more even roulade that cooks more evenly. Rub the roulade down with olive oil, season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.\nOnce the roulade is nice and evenly seasoned, roast at 400°F until the thickest part of the roulade registers to about 160°F. Allow it to rest uncovered for 20 minutes to prevent the skin from getting flabby.\nCarve and serve as desired, top it off with some gravy that is made from the homemade stock, and add a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy!	turturkeykey
608	Leftover Waffles		For the Stuffing Waffle:\nLeftover stuffing (as much as you can press into your waffle iron)\nFor the Mashed Potato Waffle (1 waffle):\n2 cups leftover mashed potatoes\n3 ounces cheddar cheese, grated\n1 egg\nFor the Sweet Potato Waffle:\n2 cups leftover sweet potatoes\n1 egg\n2 Tbsp all purpose flour	Preheat your your waffle iron and spray with with cooking spray.\nTo make a stuffing waffle, spread a layer of stuffing onto the bottom plate of the waffle iron.

Pour mixture onto waffle iron and cook as normal.\nTo make a sweet potato waffle, combine 2 cups leftover sweet potatoes with 1 beaten egg and 2 Tbsp all purpose flour. Pour mixture onto waffle iron and cook as normal.\nI recommend serving the waffles with leftover turkey and cranberry sauce, topped with some gravy.	thanksgivingleftovers
609	Leftovers Sandwich		1 leftover turkey breast, with skin\n3 slices white bread\n1 Tbsp vegetable oil\n1 Tbsp butter\nLeftover stuffing\nLeftover mashed potatoes\nLeftover cranberry sauce\nLeftover gravy\nLeftover sweet potatoes	Remove the skin from the turkey breast. Fry the skin in 1 Tbsp vegetable oil until dark brown and crisp. You can use a heavy-bottomed saucepan to help flatten the skin if needed.\nNext, prepare your bread. Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add 2 slices of white bread and toast only one side - trust me!\nPlace the third slice of bread into hot gravy to soak.\nAssemble the sandwich on a wire rack to prevent toast sweat.\nWith toast side up, start assembling. First do a layer of sliced turkey, then a thin layer of stuffing (pressed into a patty).\nTop the stuffing with a layer of cranberry sauce. On top of that, put your slice of gravy-soaked bread.\nTop the “moistmaker” with more turkey, more stuffing, and more cranberry sauce.\nOn the final slice of bread, smear the toasted side with a little leftover sweet potatoes.\nTop the sandwich with the final piece of bread (white side up). Skewer both sides and cut in half. Look at what you’ve accomplished!	thanksgivingleftovers
610	Turkey Pot Pie		Leftover turkey, shredded\nRoasted potatoes, chopped into bite-sized pieces\nAssorted leftover vegetables, chopped\n3 cups gravy\n½ cup chicken stock\n1 sheet puff pastry\n1 egg, beaten\nFlaky sea salt	Chop and prepare your fillings. You can use leftover shredded turkey along with whatever veggies you have on hand.\nThin your gravy (3 cups) with ½ cup of chicken stock.\nAdd the turkey and vegetables to the gravy and stir to combine.\nDefrost a sheet of puff pastry. Lightly flour it and roll it out until no folds remain.\nCut rounds out of the pastry - about half an inch larger than the diameter of your intended pot pie vessel - I use ramekins.\nFill ramekins to about half an inch from the top to account for bubbling.\nTop each ramekin with a round of puff pastry and press to seal.\nIf you want to freeze them, wrap each ramekin in plastic wrap twice and then foil once.\nIf you want to cook immediately, brush the tops of puff pastry with 1 beaten egg. Top with flaky sea salt.\nBake at 375°F for 40-60 minutes, depending on the size of your cooking dish.	thanksgivingleftovers
611	Osso Buco		2 medium carrots\n1 medium onion\n2 stalks celery\nFlour\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper\n6 veal shanks\nButcher’s twine\nGrapeseed oil\n1-2 Tbsp of tomato paste\n6 whole crushed cloves of garlic\n2 ½ cups dry white wine\nFresh rosemary\nFresh thyme\n2 cups beef stock\n2 dried bay leaves\n28-oz can San Marzano tomatoes	First, make a mirepoix. To make a mirepoix, take 2 medium carrots, 1 medium onion, and 2 stalks of celery, and chop them into manageable bite-sized pieces.\nHeavily season your flour with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Then use it to coat 6 veal shanks. Pat it down into the meat and flip to repeat on the other sides of each shank. To ensure the shanks’ structural integrity, tie each shank with a length of butcher’s twine.\nInto a large dutch oven, heat some grapeseed oil over medium-high heat until shimmering before dropping in the veal shanks. Give each shank 3 to 5 minutes per side until you end up with a nice brown color on both sides. It is best to perform this step in two batches so that the shanks do not become overcrowded. After searing, you will end up with leftover browned food residue (fond) that will serve as the basis of great flavor when you are braising.\nPour your mirepoix into the dutch oven and sauté for about 5 minutes until it begins to soften and turn brown. Then, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and 6 whole crushed cloves of garlic. Once you have let that sauté for an additional minute or until fragrant, deglaze the pot using about 2 ½ cups of dry white wine. For a darker and more robust stew, use a dry red wine instead.\nScrape off all of the residue from the bottom of the pot. Add a couple sprigs each of fresh rosemary and thyme, 2 cups of high quality or homemade beef stock, and 2 dried bay leaves.\nPour the entirety of one 28-oz can of San Marzano tomatoes into a mixing bowl and crush them by hand. Then, add the crushed tomatoes to the braising liquid on medium-high heat, attempting to bring it up to a simmer as you begin to add your veal shanks into the pot side-by-side. Add a few extra marrow bones to the pot as well.\nBring the mixture up to a rolling simmer and partially cover the pot. Place the pot into a 325°F oven for 2 to 3 hours.\nOnce finished, take it out of the oven and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes. The veal shanks should be tender enough to the point where you can easily pierce them with a paring knife. Get the marrow bones out of the pot and scoop out their soft rich interiors. Finely chop the interiors until it is almost a paste and add it to your risotto.\nRemove the veal shanks from the pot and set them aside. Strain the leftover sauce into a medium saucepan, making sure to stir up and press down on the solids to extract every drop of the liquid. You should end up with a thin and oily sauce. Allow it to cool for a few minutes, skim all of the fat off of the top, and reduce for about 30 minutes until it is thick and syrupy.\nFor assembling, lay down a bed of risotto on a plate, place your veal shank over top and remove the string, and ladle the braising liquid along with some of the aromatic vegetables over top before garnishing with gremolata.	ossobuco
612	Risotto alla Milanese		1 small onion\n4 cups high-quality chicken stock\nSaffron threads\n3 Tbsp butter\n2 cups Arborio or carnaroli rice\n1 cup dry white wine\nFreshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese\n2-3 Tbsp of unsalted butter\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper	Begin by finely mincing 1 small onion. Pour 4 cups of high-quality chicken stock into a small saucepan, bring it to a bare simmer, and add a pinch of saffron threads.\nInto a larger saucepan, add 3 tablespoons of butter and place over medium-high heat until it is foaming. Then, add the finely minced onion to the pan. Use a flat wooden spoon or a rubber spatula and allow it to sweat for 1 to 2 minutes until it is just beginning to turn translucent.\nTo the large saucepan, add 2 cups of Arborio or carnaroli rice and toast it in the pan with the onion for 1 to 2 minutes until the edges of the grains of rice turn translucent. At this point, add 1 cup of dry white wine and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes until the alcohol is cooked off.\nStart adding your stock, which should be a golden brown color, 1 to 2 ladlefuls at a time. Once you have added enough stock to mostly saturate the rice, stir relatively frequently until you can drag your spoon across the bottom of the pot and leave a trail. Add 1 to 2 more ladlefuls of hot stock and repeat the process over medium heat until you have added anywhere from 3 to 3 ½ cups worth of stock and the rice is creamy and tender, but slightly al dente.\nTurn off the heat and add a gracious amount of freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese as well as 2 to 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter.\nAfter adding the bone marrow interiors to the pan, season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.  Stir to combine.	ossobuco
613	Gremolata		Finely chopped parsley\nGrated lemon zest\nGrated garlic	Combine some freshly chopped parsley, grated lemon zest, and grated garlic. Mix all of it up and add enough fresh parsley to make sure that it is easy to sprinkle.	ossobuco
614	Bone Broth - Stovetop		5 lbs beef bones\n1 large yellow onion\n4 carrots\n1 stalk of celery\n1 leek\n1 bunch parsley\n½ head garlic\n2 Tbsp black peppercorns\n2 dried bay leaves\n2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar	Clean all of the bone marrow out of the bones that you can. Marrow usually gives the broth a metallic taste when marrow is left in.\nArrange the bones across some racks set in rimmed baking sheets.\nDrizzle with a little oil to assist with browning then roast the bones in a 400°F oven for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the bones are deeply browned and haven’t given up much of their fat.\nPrep the veggies: quarter 1 whole onion, peel 4 carrots and cut them in half, and cut the stalk of celery in half. Lastly, thoroughly wash and trim the leeks so they fit in the pot.\nIn one big pot (as narrow and tall as you have), place the vegetables and bones in along with half a head of garlic, 2 Tbsp of peppercorns, and 2 dried bay leaves.\nFill the pot with water and add 2 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar then bring the water/broth to and keep at a bare simmer.\nIn the first hour of cooking, skim any and all scum that floats to the top of the broth.\nStir and then let simmer for 24-48hrs.\nAfter sitting for 24-48hrs, it is time to defat the broth by skimming all of the fat that has formed at the top.\nTake a small sample in a cup and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to make sure it fully gels.\nFilter through a cheesecloth or coffee filter and enjoy.  You can also freeze it in portions and save for later.	bone-broth
615	Bone Broth - Pressure Cooker		5 lbs beef bones\n1 large yellow onion\n4 carrots\n1 stalk of celery\n1 leek\n1 bunch parsley\n½ head garlic\n2 Tbsp black peppercorns\n2 dried bay leaves\n1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar\n5-6 chicken feet	Clean all of the bone marrow out of the bones that you can. Marrow usually gives the broth a metallic taste when marrow is left in.\nArrange the bones across some racks set in rimmed baking sheets.\nDrizzle with a little oil to assist with browning then roast the bones in a 400°F oven for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the bones are deeply browned and haven’t given up much of their fat.\nPrep the veggies: quarter 1 whole onion, peel 4 carrots and cut them in half, and cut the stalk of celery in half. Lastly, thoroughly wash and trim the leeks so they fit in the pot.\nIn one big pot (as narrow and tall as you have), place the vegetables and bones in along with half a head of garlic, 2 Tbsp of peppercorns, and 2 dried bay leaves.\nTrim the claws off of 5-6 chicken feet - this helps with adding fat and gelatin to the broth.\nFill pressure cooker with water to the max capacity with 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar.\nSet to high pressure for 60 minutes - but you can go as long as 4 hours. Let the pressure release naturally.\nRemove all the solid ingredients and strain (preferably through a cheesecloth).\nPortion the broth into jars. Rapidly chill them in an ice bath and then refrigerate.	bone-broth
616	Whipped Cream - Savory		1 cup heavy cream\n2 Tbsp chopped dill\n2 pinches Kosher salt	Combine heavy cream, dill, and salt in a cup or bowl. Whisk to combine.\nIf you don’t have a CO2 whipped cream dispenser, you can whip the cream using a whisk or hand mixer.\nOr you can pour into a CO2 dispenser, shake a couple of times and dispense.	bone-broth
617	Demi-Glace		2 quarts bone broth\n2-3 Tbsp tomato paste\n1 cup dry red wine\n2 Tbsp chopped dill\n2 pinches Kosher salt	Strain (cheesecloth or coffee filter) 2 quarts of bone broth in the widest stock pot you have.\nAdd 2-3 Tbsp of tomato paste and 1 cup of dry red wine.\nBring up to a simmer and let reduce up to 75% so all that remains is thick syrupy sauce.\nOnce it is thick enough to cover the back of spoon, place in a bowl and let cool. Divy it up into portions using a cupcake tin.\nLet portions solidify in the fridge and then wrap in plastic wrap and tin foil or vacuum seal.\nPlace in freezer for up to 6 months.  It makes a great pan sauce!	bone-broth

Swirl until the milk fats separate and begin to turn brown.\nPour the butter into a heat-proof container and add 2 ice cubes to allow it to cool down rapidly. Give it a little mix for 1 to 2 minutes or until the ice cubes are fully melted.\nCombine the butter with the egg and buttermilk mixture and then pour to combine with your dry ingredients. Gently paddle to combine until you end up with a pancake batter consistency.\nUsing the same cast iron skillet that is still lubed up with about 1 tablespoon of the brown butter, add the cornbread batter and smooth it out on the top. Place the skillet into a 425°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until deep golden brown around the edges.\nEnsure that the cornbread is cooked by using a toothpick and making sure that there are only a few moist crumbs remaining on the toothpick. After allowing the cornbread to cool in the skillet for about 5 to 10 minutes, give it a drizzle of honey and brush it on for even coverage to create a shiny and sticky glaze. Then, give it a sprinkling of flaky sea salt.\nCarefully remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving while it is still warm.	cornbread

627	Porchetta Roast		1 large piece of pork belly (about ½ pound per person)\nGrated nutmeg\nOrange zest\nSage, finely chopped\nRosemary, finely chopped\nFennel fronds (or fennel seeds)\nToasted pine nuts\nKosher salt\nBlack pepper\nChili flakes\n12 garlic cloves, crushed	Remove the skin of the pork belly that will be inside the roll. Click the image above to watch the episode and see how I did it.\nDeeply score the meat inside the belly with cuts roughly two inches apart and about an inch deep. Do it in both directions to make a cross hatch pattern.\nTrim the edges of pork belly to make a perfect rectangle.\nTime to spice things up. Use the spices according to your preference and how big your roast is. I added grated nutmeg, orange zest, sage, rosemary, fennel fronds, toasted pine nuts, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and crushed garlic.\nPress the seasonings into the cuts you slit and make sure it’s all evenly distributed.\nRoll up the roast as tight as you can. Using a sharp knife, make lots of lateral cuts on the outside of the roast - just deep enough that they go through the skin, but not so deep that they go into the fat.\nTie the roast with butcher’s twine every 2-3 inches.\nPlace the roast on a rack set in a wire-rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate overnight uncovered.\nLine your baking sheet with foil, and put the wire rack and roast back inside. Set your oven to 250°F. Insert a temperature probe into the thickest part of the roast so you can monitor it.\nRoast slow and low for 3-8 hours, depending on the size of your roast. You’re waiting on it to hit an internal temperature of 160°F.\nCarefully remove from the oven - there will be a lot of liquid fat!\nCrank the oven up to 500°F. Put the roast back in and keep a close eye on it to make sure it doesn’t burn.\nLet rest for 30 minutes before slicing.	porchetta
